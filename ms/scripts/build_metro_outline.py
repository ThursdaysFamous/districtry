Metro Outline Builder (the scope mask's coverage geometry)
==========================================================
Builds data/app/metro-outline.json — for Mississippi, the dissolved outline of
the WHOLE STATE, since coverage is statewide from day one — from Census
TIGERweb. Unlike Wisconsin's narrower "roster-covered" ring, this wash makes
no partial claim: METRO_COUNTY_FIPS is all 82 counties, and
DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS stays empty on purpose — this instance has no per-county
dispatch layers.

THE COUNTY LIST HERE IS A CLAIM ABOUT COVERAGE, SO IT HAS TO TRACK WHAT
ANSWERS. Every county card names its five supervisors from the Secretary of
State's statewide directory, and every statewide layer answers in all 82
counties, so the wash claims the whole state. The supervisor DISTRICT layer
answers only in the counties whose current lines are confirmed, and that is
recorded as a gap rather than drawn as a narrower ring: the county card
answers everywhere, so a narrower wash would grey out ground the app does
answer for. If that ever stops being true, narrow METRO_COUNTY_FIPS to what
actually answers, following `wi/scripts/build_metro_outline.py` rather than
inventing a new shape.

Why this exists: the out-of-scope wash (index.html, ENGINE `scope-mask`)
marks where the app's fullest answer ends. It also keeps a boot cost out —
painting the wash from a live boundary fetch cost the reference fork 669 ms
in PSI's critical chain (docs/OPTIMIZATION_PLAYBOOK.md) before it
pre-built. This file is one small pre-dissolved feature.

WHY A BUILD STEP RATHER THAN TIGERweb's OWN STATE POLYGON (layer 0):
dissolving from the county fabric (layer 1) — rather than fetching the
state layer directly — is what lets this same script narrow to a subset of
counties the day coverage becomes partial, without changing shape. It also
means this file's geometry always agrees with `state-counties.json`'s own
fabric, since both come from the same layer.

The dissolve mirrors the app's `coverageOutlineRings` exactly: a segment
walked by two features is an interior border and is dropped; survivors
chain back into closed rings. READ THE RING COUNT FROM --check, NEVER FROM
A MAP IN YOUR HEAD — this project has got that wrong from a map more than
once. Mississippi's western border follows the Mississippi River, whose old
channels leave pieces of one state on the other bank, and its coast carries
the barrier islands, so the ring count is a measurement the --check line
prints, not a prediction made here.

Mississippi borders four states: Alabama, which no instance serves, Tennessee,
which is live, and Arkansas and Louisiana, which are being built. OUTSIDE
carries cities just over each line to prove the dissolve did not leak, and
the worksheet's negative point is in Alabama, where no instance answers.

Usage:
    python3 ms/scripts/build_metro_outline.py                 # writes data/app/metro-outline.json
    python3 ms/scripts/build_metro_outline.py --check         # verify the shipped file, write nothing

# --- the anchor registry: one anchor per served county, and no county both ----
#
# THE ANCHOR LIST IS THIS GATE'S OWN SURFACE, and until 2026-09-02 nothing
# checked it. `--check` validates the SHIPPED ring against INSIDE/OUTSIDE and
# never rebuilds from METRO_COUNTY_FIPS, so a county added to that tuple
# without an anchor is green by construction — the ring is simply never asked
# about it. That is how Wisconsin greyed out seven counties for two days with
# every gate in the repo passing, and what its validator's
# check_coverage_ring_tracks_roster was written for.
#
# The convention every instance already follows is one INSIDE anchor per served
# county, so the count identity below turns "somebody added a FIPS and forgot
# the anchor" (or the reverse) into a failure, offline, from source alone. A
# true rebuild-and-diff would be stronger and needs TIGERweb, which is why it
# is not in CI; this is what can be proven without the network.
#
# KEY SHAPES DIFFER BY INSTANCE AND BOTH ARE CORRECT. The reference instance
# keys anchors "Place (County)" because its ring is a subset of its state and a
# reader needs to know which county a town vouches for; the statewide instances
# whose ring IS the state key them by county name alone. A check that demanded
# either shape would fail correct instances, so county_of() accepts both.
