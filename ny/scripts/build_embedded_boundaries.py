"""
Regenerate the app-data boundary files in data/app/ from the full-precision
GeoJSON in data/, applying the same topology-preserving simplification the
sibling boundary layers received.

Why this exists: the boundary layers with no CORS-enabled endpoint are shipped
as same-origin static files under data/app/, fetched lazily by index.html on
first toggle (they used to be embedded inline in index.html; the P0 change moved
them out). The school-board conversion is full-precision (24,904 vertices at
14-15 decimals) and needs simplifying before it ships; this script makes that
simplification reproducible instead of a one-off manual step, so the app-data
copy can be regenerated whenever the source boundary changes and never silently
drifts from data/.

Simplification uses mapshaper (the same tool the sibling layers used), which
builds a topology and simplifies shared arcs once, so adjacent districts keep
coincident boundaries — a per-ring simplifier would create gaps/overlaps and
put some points in zero or two districts. The result is validated against the
full-precision source before anything is written: point-in-district agreement
must hold on the project's 2,000-random-point protocol and no point may fall
in two districts. If validation fails, the data file is left untouched.

Prerequisites: Node.js (mapshaper is fetched via `npx mapshaper@<pinned>`).
This is an occasional operator step (boundaries change ~once a decade), not
part of the weekly roster CI.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py            # regenerate all
    python3 scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py school-board
