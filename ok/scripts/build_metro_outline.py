Metro Outline Builder (the scope mask's coverage geometry)
==========================================================
Builds data/app/metro-outline.json — for Oklahoma, the dissolved
outline of the WHOLE STATE, since coverage is statewide from day one — from
Census TIGERweb. Unlike Wisconsin's narrower "roster-covered" ring, this
wash makes no partial claim yet: METRO_COUNTY_FIPS is all 77 counties, and
DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS stays empty on purpose — this instance has no
per-county dispatch layers, because none of its eleven layers is
county-keyed.

THE COUNTY LIST HERE IS A CLAIM ABOUT COVERAGE, SO IT HAS TO TRACK WHAT
ANSWERS. Every Oklahoma county elects three commissioners from three
districts (19 O.S. 321), and the state transport department publishes all
231 districts in one statewide file, so when `county-commissioner` arrives
it is expected to answer in all 77 counties at once and this list should
not need narrowing. If a county ever drops out of that answer, narrow
METRO_COUNTY_FIPS to what actually answers and add DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS
entries, following `wi/scripts/build_metro_outline.py` rather than inventing
a new shape. Until then, the outline is simply the state's border.

Why this exists: the out-of-scope wash (index.html, ENGINE `scope-mask`)
marks where the app's fullest answer ends. It also keeps a boot cost out —
painting the wash from a live boundary fetch cost the reference fork 669 ms
in PSI's critical chain (docs/OPTIMIZATION_PLAYBOOK.md) before it
pre-built. This file is one small pre-dissolved feature.

WHY A BUILD STEP RATHER THAN TIGERweb's OWN STATE POLYGON (layer 0):
dissolving from the county fabric (layer 1) — rather than fetching the
state layer directly — is what lets this same script narrow to a subset of
counties the day coverage becomes partial, without changing shape. It also
means this file's geometry always agrees with `state-counties.json`'s own
fabric, since both come from the same layer.

The dissolve mirrors the app's `coverageOutlineRings` exactly: a segment
walked by two features is an interior border and is dropped; survivors
chain back into closed rings. READ THE RING COUNT FROM --check, NEVER FROM
A MAP IN YOUR HEAD — this project has got that wrong from a map more than
once. Oklahoma has no coast and no county islands, so one ring is the
expected answer, and --check is what says so.

Oklahoma borders no state this fleet serves, so OUTSIDE carries four cities
just over the line (Texas twice, Arkansas, Kansas) to prove the dissolve did
not leak, and the worksheet's negative point is in Texas.

Usage:
    python3 ok/scripts/build_metro_outline.py                 # writes data/app/metro-outline.json
    python3 ok/scripts/build_metro_outline.py --check         # verify the shipped file, write nothing

# --- the anchor registry: one anchor per served county, and no county both ----
#
# THE ANCHOR LIST IS THIS GATE'S OWN SURFACE, and until 2026-09-02 nothing
# checked it. `--check` validates the SHIPPED ring against INSIDE/OUTSIDE and
# never rebuilds from METRO_COUNTY_FIPS, so a county added to that tuple
# without an anchor is green by construction — the ring is simply never asked
# about it. That is how Wisconsin greyed out seven counties for two days with
# every gate in the repo passing, and what its validator's
# check_coverage_ring_tracks_roster was written for.
#
# The convention every instance already follows is one INSIDE anchor per served
# county, so the count identity below turns "somebody added a FIPS and forgot
# the anchor" (or the reverse) into a failure, offline, from source alone. A
# true rebuild-and-diff would be stronger and needs TIGERweb, which is why it
# is not in CI; this is what can be proven without the network.
#
# KEY SHAPES DIFFER BY INSTANCE AND BOTH ARE CORRECT. The reference instance
# keys anchors "Place (County)" because its ring is a subset of its state and a
# reader needs to know which county a town vouches for; the statewide instances
# whose ring IS the state key them by county name alone. A check that demanded
# either shape would fail correct instances, so county_of() accepts both.
