"""
Source freshness gate for the app's data layers.

Why this exists: unlike the roster scrapers (which re-pull the same page every
week), several layers point at a *specific* upstream dataset that the publisher
silently supersedes with a new one:

  * Socrata portal datasets can be versioned by year. The reference fork's CPS
    attendance-boundary layers, for example, are published fresh every school
    year under a BRAND NEW dataset id (…SY2526 → …SY2627), so the id hardcoded
    in index.html keeps returning last year's boundaries long after a newer one
    exists. Nothing errors; the data just quietly goes stale.
  * Pre-built boundary layers (in this instance: the TIGERweb-derived district
    files) were downloaded at build time. The check there is provenance: is
    the source we cite still reachable, and a reminder to re-verify after
    each redistricting cycle.

This script does NOT edit index.html or any data file — swapping a dataset id
is a judgement call (the "newer" dataset may have a different schema), so, like
the roster workflows, it surfaces drift for a human instead of auto-applying it.

What it checks (findings carry a severity — FAIL, WARN, or OK):
  1. Manifest ↔ app coherence: every dataset id / data file the manifest knows
     about is still referenced in index.html (guards this file drifting from the
     app it validates).                                                   [FAIL]
  2. Socrata datasets: each id still resolves and still carries the stable part
     of its expected name (a rename usually means it was replaced).       [FAIL]
     For year-versioned datasets, the portal catalog is searched for a newer
     edition than the one in use.                                         [WARN]
  3. Shapefile provenance: the cited source URL is reachable and the built
     data/app file is present.                             [WARN / FAIL if gone]
  4. Live service endpoints (Census TIGERweb): reachable.                  [WARN]

Exit status: 0 when nothing needs a human (OK or WARN only), 1 on any FAIL.
Newer-edition detection is deliberately WARN, not FAIL — the current dataset
still works and a person decides whether/when to migrate. The scheduled
workflow (.github/workflows/ok-validate-sources.yml) opens an issue on WARN or
FAIL so drift is never silent, without turning the build red.

Usage:
    python3 ok/scripts/validate_sources.py                 # human-readable report
    python3 ok/scripts/validate_sources.py --report r.md   # also write markdown
    python3 ok/scripts/validate_sources.py --status-file s.txt   # ok|warn|fail
    python3 ok/scripts/validate_sources.py --offline       # manifest↔app checks only
