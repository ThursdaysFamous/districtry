"""
Post-rewrite sanity gate for the app and its generated data files.

The weekly roster workflows regenerate the officeholder rosters under
data/app/*.json (scripts/build_congress_roster.py, build_ca_legislature_roster.py)
and open a PR. Those builders validate their *input* (they refuse an incomplete roster),
but this script is the *output*-side gate: run it after any regeneration and
before opening a PR to confirm the app and its data are still coherent.

Before the P0 externalization these datasets were spliced into object literals
inside index.html and the risk was a mis-anchored regex dropping live code.
Now the builders emit plain JSON with json.dump (no splice, no escaping), so the
checks here are: index.html still parses and carries every layer, it no longer
embeds any dataset inline, and every app-data file is present and well formed.

Checks (all must pass; exits non-zero on the first failure):
  1. The main inline <script> still parses (`node --check`).
  2. registerLayer( appears at least as many times as expected, AND every layer
     id in EXPECT_LAYER_IDS is registered. Most layers register through the
     factories, so a lost factory-registered module would not move the raw
     registerLayer( count — the per-id check catches that (ported from the NYC
     fork per docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md backlog item 8, "port checks, not bytes").
  3. index.html embeds no dataset inline (no `JSON.parse('...')` blobs remain)
     and references each data/app/* file it fetches.
  4. Every expected data/app/*.json exists, parses, and has the right shape.
  5. LAYER_AREA_RANK lists every registered layer id exactly once and nothing
     else — the z-order honesty rule made executable so a layer can never be
     registered but forgotten in the stack (or vice versa).
  6. METRO_EXPLORERS entries are well formed (id/label/https url; bbox, when
     present, is a sane min<max box that does NOT contain this metro's own
     center — a bbox covering home would make the sibling-metro portal easter
     egg fire on every pan). Guards the copy-verbatim config diff every fork
     applies when a new metro launches.
  7. sw.js exactly-one-list invariant: every data/app/*.json on disk is
     cached in exactly one of the service worker's GEOMETRY_URLS / ROSTER_URLS,
     so no data file is ever un-cached or double-listed.
