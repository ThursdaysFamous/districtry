Post-rewrite sanity gate for the app and its generated data files.

The weekly roster workflows regenerate the officeholder rosters under
data/app/*.json (scripts/build_il_roster.py, build_cpd_roster.py) and open a
PR. Those builders validate their *input* (they refuse an incomplete roster),
but this script is the *output*-side gate: run it after any regeneration and
before opening a PR to confirm the app and its data are still coherent.

Before the P0 externalization these datasets were spliced into object literals
inside index.html and the risk was a mis-anchored regex dropping live code.
Now the builders emit plain JSON with json.dump (no splice, no escaping), so the
checks here are: index.html still parses and carries every layer, it no longer
embeds any dataset inline, and every app-data file is present and well formed.

Checks (all must pass; exits non-zero on the first failure):
  1. The main inline <script> still parses (`node --check`).
  2. registerLayer( appears at least as many times as expected, AND every layer
     id in EXPECT_LAYER_IDS is registered. Most layers register through the
     factories, so a lost factory-registered module would not move the raw
     registerLayer( count — the per-id check catches that (ported from the NYC
     fork per docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md backlog item 8, "port checks, not bytes").
  3. index.html embeds no dataset inline (no `JSON.parse('...')` blobs remain)
     and references each data/app/* file it fetches.
  4. Every expected data/app/*.json exists, parses, and has the right shape.
  5. LAYER_AREA_RANK lists every registered layer id exactly once and nothing
     else — the z-order honesty rule made executable so a layer can never be
     registered but forgotten in the stack (or vice versa).
  6. METRO_EXPLORERS entries are well formed (id/label/https url; bbox, when
     present, is a sane min<max box that does NOT contain this metro's own
     center — a bbox covering home would make the sibling-metro portal easter
     egg fire on every pan). Guards the copy-verbatim config diff every fork
     applies when a new metro launches.
  7. sw.js exactly-one-list invariant: every data/app/*.json on disk is
     cached in exactly one of the service worker's GEOMETRY_URLS / ROSTER_URLS,
     so no data file is ever un-cached or double-listed.
  8. Every county with a per-county dispatch entry is inside the scope mask's
     county list, DERIVED from index.html rather than from a hand-kept list.
     The wash claims "beyond here only the statewide layers answer"; this is
     what stops that claim going stale, as it did for LaSalle, Kankakee, Boone
     and Grundy across two research passes with no gate noticing.

    """Every county the app dispatches a layer on must be inside the scope mask.

    VACUOUS IN THIS INSTANCE, AND THAT IS WHY THE CHECK BELOW EXISTS.
    Kentucky registers no registerCountyLayer dispatch entries at all — this
    instance's four day-one layers are all statewide — so this walks an empty
    set and returns 0 on every run. It is kept because the shape is shared with the reference
    instance and a future dispatch entry must be covered from its first day,
    not because it is currently measuring anything.

    THE BUG IT EXISTS FOR, in an instance that does dispatch: the mask's county
    list was previously guarded only by the outline builder's OUTSIDE anchors,
    which catch a county only if somebody had already thought to name it. Four
    of the reference instance's counties therefore shipped layers and stayed
    greyed out for two research passes — the wash telling residents "beyond
    here only the statewide layers answer" while five of their layers answered.
    Nothing failed, because nothing was comparing the list against what the app
    actually registers. In Kentucky that comparison is
    check_coverage_ring_tracks_counties(), below.

    So this derives the answer instead of trusting a list: it reads the county
    keys out of index.html's own dispatch tables and requires each one to be in
    METRO_COUNTY_FIPS. An unrecognised key fails too — a new county that nobody
    added to DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS is exactly the case that used to slip through.

    IT ALSO CHECKS THE REVERSE, which for a long time nothing did: a
    DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS row with no dispatch entry behind it. That gap was
    found on 2026-08-02 while shipping the at-large tier (Pike, Brown, Calhoun,
    Putnam) — counties served entirely through the COUNTY card, with no dispatch
    entry of any kind. The expansion guide had said to add such a county to
    DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS "if any other layer answers there", and adding one
    anyway passed every gate silently, because this function only ever looked
    from index.html outward. A stale row is not cosmetic: DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS
    is what build_county_outline.py cross-checks FIPS against and what the
    guidebook and CLAUDE.md quote as the count of dispatched counties, so a
    county listed there but dispatching nothing makes all three quietly wrong.
    An at-large county belongs in METRO_COUNTY_FIPS only.
