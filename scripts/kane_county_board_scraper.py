"""
Scrape the Kane County Board member roster from the county's own SharePoint
list API.

Stage 1 of the two-stage roster pipeline (the Will/Kendall/McHenry shape);
scripts/build_kane_county_board_roster.py resolves the raw records into
data/app/kane-county-board-members.json, keyed by county-board district
("1".."24") plus a top-level "chair" for the countywide-elected Board Chair
(the DuPage roster shape), which index.html's consolidated county-board
layer joins to the county's own KaneCo_IL_County_Board boundary GIS by
district number (the GIS keeps carrying the sitting member's NAME — this
roster adds party, the official office phone, email, and a profile link).

Source: the directory page at
  https://www2.kanecountyil.gov/pages/countyboard/boardMembers.aspx
is a SharePoint page whose member table is rendered client-side from the
site's own REST API — the page's inline script calls

  GET /_api/web/lists/getbytitle('Board Members')/items?$orderby=District
  Accept: application/json;odata=nometadata

anonymously, and this scraper calls exactly that endpoint (no HTML parsing,
no browser, no bot-management ladder: unlike the Kendall/McHenry sites,
Kane's does not block automated clients — verified 2026-07-23). Fields
used: ID, FullName, District (null for the countywide Chair), Party,
Office/Cell/Home (the first non-empty is the published contact number —
Office is the county's official 630-444-12NN board line), E_x002d_Mail
(SharePoint's encoding of "E-Mail", a mailto: URL), and the Chairman flag.
The Chair's FullName carries a ", Madam Chair"-style suffix that is
stripped (the role is emitted separately); the record's Address (the
Government Center) and ServiceStart/Expires are not collected — the card
convention carries contact, not terms, and members' Address fields are
empty anyway.

Notes on data honesty (per project conventions):
- Values are read verbatim from the county's own list; a missing field is
  stored null, never guessed.
- Every record includes `source_url` (the member's own profile page, built
  from the list ID exactly as the county's directory links do) and
  `scraped_at` for traceability.
