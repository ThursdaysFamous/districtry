CCPSA District Council Councilor Scraper
========================================
Extracts the elected District Councilors (name + role on the council + member
profile link) for each of Chicago's 22 Police District Councils, from the
Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability's own per-district
pages at ccpsa.chicago.gov.

Why scrape rather than call an API: the July 2021 ordinance that created the
CCPSA also created 22 District Councils — one per Chicago Police District — each
with three Councilors elected in the regular municipal elections. Those elected
Councilor names exist in no queryable open dataset (confirmed 2026-07-09 by an
initial dataset search); they are only published as rendered HTML on the CCPSA
site's per-district-council pages. This scraper is the operator-run, build-time
step that produces a static JSON, later written to
data/app/ccpsa-district-councils.json by scripts/build_ccpsa_roster.py (same
two-stage pattern as scripts/ilga_scraper.py + scripts/build_il_roster.py).

Unlike CPD's site (see scripts/cpd_district_scraper.py), ccpsa.chicago.gov is
not fronted by a Cloudflare JS challenge — a plain requests client gets the full
rendered HTML — so this scraper stays browserless (requests + BeautifulSoup),
matching the simpler ilga_scraper.py template.

District-council page URLs are discovered from the site's own
district-council-sitemap.xml rather than hardcoded, so a future re-numbering
(districts 13 and 21 were retired before, which is why only 22 councils exist:
1-12, 14-20, 22, 24, 25) can't silently drop or mis-map a council.

Usage:
    python3 ccpsa_scraper.py --out ccpsa_district_councils.json

Notes on data honesty (per project conventions):
- If a field can't be found on a page, it is stored as null / empty list,
  never guessed or fabricated.
- Every record includes `source_url` and `scraped_at` for traceability.
- The council markup is a stable WordPress template (`.member-column` cards with
  an `h3.title` name + `p.position` role + `a.see-more` profile link), so parsing
  keys on those classes; it degrades to an empty member list rather than crashing
  if the template changes.

    The council page renders each Councilor as a `.member-column` card holding an

    "Nominating Committee", "Community Engagement"), and an `a.see-more` link to
    the member's profile. A card with no name is skipped rather than emitted with
    a null name — an unnamed Councilor is meaningless.

    A SEAT CCPSA PRINTS AS VACANT IS KEPT, and that is the one card that is not
    meaningless without a name. Each council seats three under named roles, so a
    dropped card would make the body look smaller than the city elects; the row
    carries the seat's role with `vacant` and no name at all. Measured
    2026-09-23 on the live pages: the 3rd and 12th councils each print the word
    in the `h3.title` where a name goes, with "Nominating Committee" beside it,
    and an `a.see-more` to ccpsa.chicago.gov/member/vacant/ — which answers 200
    and is a profile page for nobody, so it is not carried. Until this change
    the word shipped as the member's NAME and reached il/police-district.html as
