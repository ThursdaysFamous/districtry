"""Rewrite traffic.html's data block from the three committed data files.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT. The report was rebuilt by hand: a session read the three
JSON files, worked out each figure, and spliced five declarations into the page.
That is half an hour of careful work every day, and every one of those days is a
chance to paste a number into the wrong array. Everything between the
TRAFFIC-DATA markers is now derived, so the daily refresh is one command and the
only judgment left is the PROSE, which is where judgment belongs.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately:

  * It does not touch a word of prose. The page's sentences make claims the data
    can outlive — "ward leads", "the four days ran", the 2026-08-24 root-split
    caveat — and a generator that rewrote those would be inventing them. Read
    the reconciliation this prints, then read the page.
  * It is NOT a CI gate. The three fetch workflows commit their files on their
    own schedule, so between a fetch and the next rebuild the page and the data
    legitimately disagree; a --check in CI would fail main every day for hours.
    --check exists for a person about to rebuild, to see what would move.

THE TWO TOTALS ARE BOTH PRINTED AND NEITHER IS DERIVED FROM THE OTHER.
GoatCounter's js-total-utc is what the bar widgets are a share of — the browser,
system and location rows sum to it exactly — while the daily series sums lower.
Both count the same period, this project does not know what the difference is,
and an earlier note explaining it as deduplication was wrong in the direction it
predicted (that would make the total SMALLER; it is larger).
