CPD District Commander/Contact Scraper
=======================================
Extracts commander name + status, CAPS unit phone/email, station address,
neighborhood list, and district-map link for each Chicago Police Department
police district, from CPD's own per-district pages.

Why scrape rather than call an API: the commander name/status/bio and the CAPS
unit phone/email exist in no queryable open dataset (confirmed — see
docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md §2c, re-confirmed 2026-07-09 by sweeping CPD's own
ArcGIS org, which carries only station address/phone + boundaries). They are
only available as rendered HTML on CPD's per-district pages, which send no
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, so they can't be fetched client-side by the
browser app either. This scraper is the operator-run, build-time step that
produces a static JSON, later written to data/app/cpd-district-info.json by
scripts/build_cpd_roster.py (same pattern as scripts/ilga_scraper.py +
scripts/build_il_roster.py for the IL rosters).

Fetch engines (`--engine`): CPD fronts these pages with Cloudflare's *managed*
(JavaScript) challenge, which returns HTTP 403 to a plain `requests` client that
can't execute the challenge JS. The `playwright` engine drives a real headless
Chromium that runs the challenge and reads the resulting rendered HTML — no
evasion, just a genuine browser — and hands identical HTML to the same parser.
`--engine auto` (default) tries `requests` first (fast, no browser) and falls
back to `playwright` the moment the finder page is blocked, so the job works
whether or not the runner's IP gets challenged.

District slugs are discovered from CPD's own district-finder page rather
than hardcoded, since districts have been merged/renumbered before and a
stale hardcoded list would silently drop or mis-map districts.

Usage:
    python3 cpd_district_scraper.py --out cpd_district_info.json
    python3 cpd_district_scraper.py --engine playwright --out cpd_district_info.json
    python3 cpd_district_scraper.py --engine requests --out cpd_district_info.json

The playwright engine needs the `playwright` package and a Chromium build
(`python3 -m playwright install chromium`); the weekly workflow installs both.
Set CPD_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE to point at a pre-installed browser binary if the
default channel isn't present (e.g. a shared PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH).

Notes on data honesty (per project conventions):
- If a field can't be found on a page, it is stored as null / empty list,
  never guessed or fabricated.
- Every record includes `source_url` and `scraped_at` for traceability.
- Markup on these pages is plain WordPress/UiKit blocks with no stable data
  attributes or consistent CSS classes, so parsing here is heuristic (text/
  heading search, tel:/mailto: link scan) rather than fixed selectors.
