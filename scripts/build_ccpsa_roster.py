"""
Resolve scripts/ccpsa_scraper.py's raw output into one record per District
Council and write it as the JSON app-data file the CCPSA District Council card
reads: data/app/ccpsa-district-councils.json, keyed by police-district number.

index.html fetches this file lazily on first click (same-origin, no CORS needed)
and joins it to the police-district boundary the app already loads — the CCPSA's
22 District Councils share the CPD district boundaries exactly (one council per
district). Same two-stage build pattern as scripts/ilga_scraper.py +
scripts/build_il_roster.py and scripts/cpd_district_scraper.py +
scripts/build_cpd_roster.py.

Usage:
    python3 build_ccpsa_roster.py ccpsa_district_councils.json [output_dir]

output_dir defaults to the repo's data/app/ directory.
