"""
Build this state's U.S. House roster (district -> current officeholder +
offices) as a same-origin app-data file, so the congress card no longer
downloads the full national roster to every browser. The state comes from
data/state/state.json (South Carolina: USPS SC, 7 seats), which overrides the
reference fork's inert IL defaults below — one script, parameterized by data.

The reference fork's index.html used to fetch unitedstates/congress-legislators'
legislators-current.json (~1.5 MB, all ~538 members with every term each has
ever served) at click time and filter it client-side for the one matching
representative — using a few hundred bytes of a multi-megabyte payload. This
script does that filtering once at build time and writes this state's reps to
data/app/congress-roster.json (a few KB), which index.html fetches lazily on
first click (same-origin, no CORS, no third-party host dependency at runtime).

Each entry now carries the two offices the card renders through the shared
chamber factory (registerIlgaChamber), matching this fork's chamber cards:

  - capitolOffice  the Washington, D.C. office (room + building, city, phone),
                   from the legislator's current term.
  - districtOffice the member's primary local (in-district) office — street,
                   city/ZIP, phone — from legislators-district-offices.json,
                   joined by bioguide id. This is the office the card pins on
                   the map. A member can have several district offices; we emit
                   the first listed (typically the main one). Nearest-to-click
                   selection and the source's per-office lat/long are a possible
                   future refinement.

Both office feeds are the same canonical @unitedstates/congress-legislators
project already trusted for name/party — never guessed. District-office data is
crowdsourced from members' official sites there; if that feed is unreachable at
build time we still ship the D.C. office (the district office is simply omitted,
and the card degrades to the same surface as any member without one).

A weekly GitHub Action (.github/workflows/update-sc-congress-roster.yml) reruns
this and opens a PR when the roster changes, so officeholder data still gets a
human look before it ships.

Usage:
    python3 build_congress_roster.py [legislators-current.json] [output_dir]

With no arguments it downloads the sources and writes to the repo's data/app/.
Pass a local legislators-current.json to build offline (the district-office
feed is still fetched from the network unless it is cached alongside it as
legislators-district-offices.json); pass an output_dir to redirect the write
(used by tests).
