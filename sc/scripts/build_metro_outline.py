Metro Outline Builder (the scope mask's coverage geometry)
==========================================================
Builds data/app/metro-outline.json — for South Carolina, the dissolved
outline of the WHOLE STATE, since coverage is statewide from day one — from
Census TIGERweb. Unlike Wisconsin's narrower "roster-covered" ring, this
wash makes no partial claim yet: METRO_COUNTY_FIPS is all 46 counties, and
DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS stays empty on purpose — this instance has no
per-county dispatch layers, because none of its ten layers is county-keyed.

THE COUNTY LIST HERE IS A CLAIM ABOUT COVERAGE, SO IT HAS TO TRACK WHAT
ANSWERS. Every South Carolina county is governed by a county council, and the
state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office publishes every county's council
districts in one statewide file (315 districts across all 46 counties,
measured by the planning pass on 2026-10-09), so when `county-council`
arrives it is expected to answer in all 46 counties at once and this list
should not need narrowing. If a county ever drops out of that answer, narrow
METRO_COUNTY_FIPS to what actually answers and add DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS
entries, following `wi/scripts/build_metro_outline.py` rather than inventing
a new shape. Until then, the outline is simply the state's border.

Why this exists: the out-of-scope wash (index.html, ENGINE `scope-mask`)
marks where the app's fullest answer ends. It also keeps a boot cost out —
painting the wash from a live boundary fetch cost the reference fork 669 ms
in PSI's critical chain (docs/OPTIMIZATION_PLAYBOOK.md) before it
pre-built. This file is one small pre-dissolved feature.

WHY A BUILD STEP RATHER THAN TIGERweb's OWN STATE POLYGON (layer 0):
dissolving from the county fabric (layer 1) — rather than fetching the
state layer directly — is what lets this same script narrow to a subset of
counties the day coverage becomes partial, without changing shape. It also
means this file's geometry always agrees with `state-counties.json`'s own
fabric, since both come from the same layer.

The dissolve mirrors the app's `coverageOutlineRings` exactly: a segment
walked by two features is an interior border and is dropped; survivors
chain back into closed rings. READ THE RING COUNT FROM --check, NEVER FROM
A MAP IN YOUR HEAD — this project has got that wrong from a map more than
once. South Carolina has a sea coast with barrier islands, so the ring count
is a measurement the --check line prints, not a prediction made here.

South Carolina borders two states: Georgia, which no instance serves, and
North Carolina, which is live. OUTSIDE carries three cities just over each
line to prove the dissolve did not leak, and the worksheet's negative point
is in Georgia, where no instance answers.

Usage:
    python3 sc/scripts/build_metro_outline.py                 # writes data/app/metro-outline.json
    python3 sc/scripts/build_metro_outline.py --check         # verify the shipped file, write nothing
