## What a reader gets today

Click any point in Michigan and the app answers from **15 layers** — the fewest
in the fleet, because Michigan is the newest instance (live 2026-09-03). The
state House and Senate rosters are complete at 110 and 38.

**20 recorded gaps** — 13 no-source, 5 blocked, 2 data-quality. Eighteen of the
twenty are city council wards.

## Tasks — manager owns this section

| task | state | opened | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Commissioner roster covers 16 of 83 counties** | open | — | The headline gap and the layer the instance was built around. The runway already exists: the probe in #989 measured 59 counties. Next is tranche 5 onward against that list, not more discovery. |
| City council wards — 18 of the 20 gaps | open | — | Ann Arbor and Jackson blocked; Bay City data-quality; Dearborn, Detroit, Flint, Holland, Kentwood no-source. **Run the state's WARD column first** (`mi/WATCH.md` line 30) — one query settled 23 cities on 2026-09-06. `WARD='00'` means stop. |
| Tranche parser candidates | open | — | Carried from this session's last report. |
| Detroit PR-body proposal | open | — | Carried from this session's last report. |
| PR #979 | open | — | Carried from this session's last report; state unverified by the manager. |
| Michigan's full bbox vs. the clipped one | open | 2026-09-04 | The county fabric is water-inclusive and runs west across Lake Michigan to -90.42, containing Chicago's and Wisconsin's centres. Shipped clipped to `lng >= -87.60`. Four western-UP places still misroute at the front door. Recorded in `mi/WATCH.md`; no fix proposed. |

**Wyoming (MI) is off limits.** Its own robots.txt names ClaudeBot and disallows
the whole site. Do not fetch it with a browser user-agent.

## Status — this session owns this section

**2026-09-19, later.** Tranche 5 is open as #1033. Ten more counties name your
commissioner: Barry, Cheboygan, Dickinson, Hillsdale, Ionia, Kalkaska,
Leelanau, Oceana, Osceola and Sanilac. That takes the card from 16 counties to
26, from 165 named seats to 229, and from 51.6% of Michigan's people to 55.1%.
Each of the ten also gets its own page under `mi/county-commissioner/`, where
the names are in the served bytes rather than behind a fetch.

**The weekly refresh has now run.** I dispatched it by hand rather than waiting
for the cron: run 35415178348, every step green, and no change — so the
sixteen counties shipped before this tranche still name the same people. The
job works end to end and that is now measured rather than assumed.

Three things worth knowing from the work:

- **Two of the probe's candidates cannot be fetched at all.** Gogebic and
  Marquette each serve a robots.txt that disallows this client, read three
  times in a row, byte-identical to each other and to Genesee's and Ingham's.
  Both were recorded as candidates the day before. Either those files changed
  inside a day or the probe's read differed, and I cannot tell which: no
  archive holds either file, and the probe writes a robots status only for the
  hosts it rejects. That is the probe's own gap and it is recorded in its
  docstring.
- **Hillsdale is the opposite case.** Its robots.txt failed twice with a
  connection reset — which is disallow-all — and served a file allowing this
  path on the third try. A single transport failure is not a measurement. The
  scraper retries the transport now; it still takes a refusal and an HTTP
  status as answers.
- **Ionia District 3 is a seat the county itself calls vacant**, which is a
  third kind of unnamed seat beside Monroe's malformed row and Lenawee's
  self-contradiction, and gets its own sentence on the card. Its page carries
  the previous commissioner's whole entry commented out beneath the word, so a
  parser that reads comments would name a man the county has removed.

Every host in the tranche saw two requests, robots.txt and the page. Each page
was saved once and every parser written offline against the copy, because six
sweeps in four days tripped a WAF on Tuscola while the probe was being written.

Next: the 24 candidates this tranche did not take. They need no new discovery.

**2026-09-19.** Picking up tranche 5: more county commissioner names, from the
34 counties the probe in #989 measured as publishing a district-keyed board
page.

What the commissioner card gives a reader today is a name in 16 of 83 counties.
That is 165 of the 619 seats and 5,200,503 of Michigan's 10,077,331 people,
51.6%. In the other 67 counties the card gives the district number and names
nobody. The 34 candidates are 216 more seats and 1,064,500 more people;
shipping all of them would take it to 62.2%.

The candidates in population order start Clinton 79,128, Ionia 66,804, Montcalm
66,614, Marquette 66,017, Isabella 64,394, Barry 62,423, Cass 51,589. Clinton is
the largest of the 34, and 15 of them are under 25,000 people. Michigan is a
long tail from here, so a tranche is worth judging by seats and by whether the
page yields, not by population.

**The weekly refresh has never run.** `update-mi-commissioner-roster.yml` has
zero runs, ever. It is wired correctly — cron `30 20 * * 6`, `workflow_dispatch`,
in the shared root — but it landed on Saturday 2026-09-13 after that week's slot,
and tonight is the first Saturday since. So the 16 counties' names have not been
re-checked since the day they shipped, and the job has never been proven end to
end. I am dispatching it by hand rather than waiting for the cron.

The three items carried into the Tasks table, with the state I measured them in:

- **PR #979** merged on 2026-09-16. Its whole diff was one line: Detroit's
  roster going from `archivedAt: null` to a real snapshot stamp, so the card now
  prints which day's archived copy it read.
- **Tranche parser candidates** is `mi/data/source/mi-county-board-probe.json`,
  measured 2026-09-18: 34 candidate, 11 no-board-page, 7 no-districts, 3
  not-keyable, 2 no-confirmed-host, 2 challenge. It is the tranche 5 work list.
  `candidate` means a parser is worth writing, never that the county will ship.
- **Detroit PR-body proposal** is not implemented and is written down nowhere in
  the repo. The weekly Detroit PR body is one static paragraph, identical every
  week whatever changed, so it cannot tell a reviewer that a run moved a
  snapshot stamp rather than a person's name. It is worth doing and it is worth
  less than the roster.

Two corrections to my own last report:

- I said Emmet publishes 10 e-mail addresses as `mailto`. It publishes no
  `mailto` and ten Cloudflare-obfuscated ones. Same information, different
  markup — the Brown County shape the Kent and Lapeer parsers already decode.
  Lake (14) and Schoolcraft (5) are the same.
- Seven of the 34 candidates have a state-layer population that disagrees with
  the census, and Cheboygan's seven districts all publish Population 0 against a
  census 25,579. The probe artifact records the layer's figure and says so; every
  share above has the census on both sides.

## Open questions for Adam

- Nothing outstanding.
