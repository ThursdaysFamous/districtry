# Card Render API — helper surface for the info-card redesign

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** — engine release N (`card-helpers` + `styles-card-v2`
fences, shell mounts, chamber/nearest/polygon-compact factories) and the
Chicago fork wave (county-board ×7 counties, school-board, ccbr, ward, ccpsa,
county clerk, police-district, ward-precinct/police-beat compact, 4c footer
links) are live. Two additive extensions landed during implementation:
`renderLinkRow` also accepts `phone`/`email` (office-like rows such as a CAPS
desk), and `registerPolygonLayer` passes through `opts.primaryLink`.
**Wave 3 is also live**: `renderFieldStack` (the generic label-over-value
stack) joined the helper set and now serves the generic `polygon-factory` /
`polygonCountyEntry` paths and every county-concept entry (judicial-
subcircuit, fire/park/library districts, county-precinct — links moved to
entry-level `primaryLink`); `school-zone-factory` grew the data-only
`profileLink(id)`/`moreLink` opts (Chicago's CPS zones use them) and
`cps-network-factory` renders chief + office natively; `renderLinkRow`
gained a `note` line. **The fleet is at zero `renderFieldList` call sites** — Chicago in
#172/#173, NYC in its #68, SF in its #34. The four surviving references
(polygon-factory, polygonCountyEntry, school-zone ×2) are the sibling-
compat legacy branches, now dead code: no spec anywhere still carries
caller-HTML opts. `school-site` keeps its bespoke filter card by
design. **The retirement shipped as engine-v1.0.13** (once the grep hit
zero): `renderFieldList`, its `.result-row` CSS, the factories' legacy
caller-HTML branches, and the debug-namespace export are all gone. The
`render-helper` fence is kept as a tombstone comment rather than deleted —
the pipeline rejects an empty fence and a cross-fork fence-set change would
force sibling pre-clean PRs for no functional gain (see
`docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md` item 13; that tombstone-not-delete rule is now the
fleet convention for retiring a shared helper).
**Handoff 3** (`docs/design_handoff_fixes_and_schools/`, ids 5a–5d/6a/8a–8b)
extended the surface again: `<details>` expanders default **closed**
everywhere (§5d — `detailsOpen`/`open` remain as explicit opt-ins no caller
currently passes), the id pill and card shadow are tinted with the layer
color (§5a, CSS-only), `cardTitleCase`/`cardGradeRange` joined the helpers
(§6a), `renderNearestRows` grew `tag`/`accentColor` (§8a), and
`school-zone-factory` grew `titleCaseData` + the grade-range identifier
pill (§6a). Chicago's `school-site` bespoke card was rebuilt on chips +
`renderNearestRows` (§8a/8b).

**Handoff 4** (`docs/design_handoff_hover_popup/`, ids 9a/10a + 10c's
standalone block) carried the system onto the map's hover snapshot, so hover
and click now speak the same visual language — a hovered stack reads as a
preview of the cards a click would open. The dark plate is retired.
`hoverSnapshotHTML` (an HTML-string builder, the last one on this surface)
became `hoverSnapshotNode`, which builds DOM through `cardEl` like every other
card path; nothing on the layer contract changed — `hoverName`,
`hoverOfficial`, `pointOfInterest` and the `hoveredPoi` token keep their
behavior. Three things are worth knowing before porting it:

- **Layer color is no longer printable verbatim.** On the old near-black plate
  any palette color was legible; on the card surface the pale blues and
  near-whites are not. `hoverPillStyle()` derives a printable pair from the
  same color the dot shows — darkening the text toward black until it clears
  AA (4.5:1) on white while the tint keeps the original hue — and
  `hoverDotIsInvisible()` swaps a near-white dot for a ringed one. Both key off
  WCAG relative luminance, so no second palette exists to drift.
- **A hovered pin is the popup's subject, not a row.** It takes a promoted
  header block (eyebrow = layer label, name = the segment of `line()` before
  the first " — ", address = the remainder). Its pill is read from its own
  layer's row rather than carried on the token, so the pin and the row beneath
  it cannot disagree; a nearest-N pin, which has no such row, supplies
  `distanceLabel` instead.
- **No own row means no stack** (10c). A station/library/post-office dot's
  layer has no polygon footprint to anchor the header to, so the header block
  *is* the popup and the surrounding districts are left to the click cards.

Districts shown for a pin are the pin's, not the cursor's — `updateHover`
already anchored the stack at `poi.latlng`, so this needed no change.

**v1.0.15** fenced the popup to the map viewport. `fenceHoverPopup()` clamps it
horizontally, flips it below the cursor when there isn't room above, and slides
the tail back so it still points at the spot being read; `autoPan` stays off,
because panning would move the thing being inspected out from under the reader
and the popup would chase itself. It measures the rendered box and corrects by
the delta rather than deriving a position — Leaflet's placement already accounts
for the tail strip, zoom animation and content size. Two invariants to preserve
when touching it: the flipped state changes **only** the tail, never
`.leaflet-popup`'s margins (so one measure-correct pass is enough), and
`showHover` resets the offset each frame so corrections don't compound. The same
release fixed a v1.0.14 bug — the popup now declares `maxWidth: 324`, without
which Leaflet's default 300 wrote an inline width that beat the stylesheet and
rendered every hover card 24px narrower than the design.

This is the engineering contract for implementing the card redesign specified in
`docs/design_handoff_county_board_card/` (Handoff 1, County Board card, design
ids 3a–3d) and `docs/design_handoff_card_system/` (Handoff 2, all card types,
ids 4a–4e). It defines the shared helper functions, the `registerLayer` contract
additions, and the rollout sequencing. The API is the load-bearing decision: it
fixes what fork-local layer modules pass versus what the engine renders, and
therefore both the engine diff and the per-fork migration that follows it.

## Why the API is shaped this way

Card rendering is split across the parity fence line:

- **Engine-fenced** (byte-identical across Chicago/NYC/SF, ships via the
  `engine-v*` release pipeline — `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md`): the card shell and
  states (`overlay-cards`), the shared row builder `renderFieldList`
  (`render-helper`), the card CSS (`styles-app`), and the factories that render
  whole card families (`polygon-factory`, `chamber-factory`,
  `nearest-point-factory`, `school-zone-factory`, `cps-network-factory`,
  `office-helpers`).
- **Fork-local**: ~30 `renderFieldList` call sites per fork in metro layer
  modules (county dispatcher entries, ward, CCBR, …), which NYC/SF mirror with
  their own code.

An engine bump lands in sibling forks **before** their local modules are
converted. The API below is therefore **additive**: `renderFieldList` and its
`dt`/`dd` output keep working unchanged until every fork's call sites have
migrated; a later engine release deletes it. New helpers live in a **new**
ENGINE fence (`card-helpers`) so release N's diff is a pure addition and the
retirement release deletes the old fence without touching the new one.

## Hard rules the helpers enforce

1. **Callers pass data, never markup.** No helper accepts an `html` field. The
   `f.html` "caller certifies this was built with sanitize()" escape hatch in
   `renderFieldList` does not carry over; migrated layers cannot inject markup
   at all. All text lands via `textContent`; all attributes via `setAttribute`.
2. **URLs are scheme-checked centrally.** Every external `url` passes through
   `safeHttpUrl` inside the helper (http/https only, else the link is dropped);
   external links get `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`. `mailto:`/`tel:` hrefs
   are **constructed by the helper** from a raw address/number — callers never
   build hrefs.
3. **Email is never printed.** Per Handoff 1: a raw address renders as an
   "Email" link with the `mailto:` behind it.
4. **Phone display vs. dial value.** Displayed numbers use non-breaking hyphens
   (U+2011) and `tabular-nums`; the `tel:` href strips to digits/`+`. The
   helper does both from one input string. Phones are always links (`tel:` is
   harmless on desktop and required on mobile).
5. **Honesty rules unchanged.** Helpers render exactly what they are passed;
   absent fields render nothing (no placeholders, no guessed officeholders).

## The helpers (new `card-helpers` ENGINE fence)

All return a DOM node/fragment for the module's `render(result)` to compose and
return, exactly as `renderFieldList` does today. ES5 throughout.

### `renderBodyIntro(spec)`

The body-name + count line under the header (Handoff 1 "Body intro").

```js
renderBodyIntro({
  title: "DuPage County Board",          // 14px/600 line
  note: "3 district members · 1 countywide chair"   // optional 12px muted line
})
```

### `renderPersonRows(people, opts)`

The core Handoff 1 vocabulary: one row per person; a person with `details`
becomes a native `<details>` expander (summary = the row, chevron hint).

```js
renderPersonRows([{
  name: "Sherry Williams",               // required; 14.5px/700
  badge: "Democratic Leader",            // optional role/party chip
  note: "Crest Hill",                    // optional muted inline text (hometown)
  phone: "815-354-7291",                 // optional; rendered per rule 4
  email: "swilliams@willcounty.gov",     // optional; renders as "Email" link (rule 3)
  links: [{ label: "Profile", url: "https://…" }],  // optional external links (rule 2)
  details: { label: "Committees",        // optional; presence makes the row an expander
             items: ["Public Works & Transportation", "Landfill (Chair)"] },
  detailsOpen: true                      // optional; force-open (see below — avoid)
}], { tinted: true })                    // opts.tinted: the #f8fafc section bg
                                         // (countywide rows); omit for plain rows
```

`details.items` are plain strings joined with " · " by the helper — role
annotations like "(Chair)" are part of the string, formatted by the caller.
Per Handoff 3 §5d, expanders default **closed** on every card, desktop and
mobile; `detailsOpen` remains as an explicit opt-in that no current caller
passes (the original desktop-width auto-open was removed).

### `renderSectionLabel(text)`

The uppercase kicker divider row ("COUNTYWIDE") that precedes a tinted
`renderPersonRows(people, {tinted: true})` block.

### `renderOfficeGroup(spec)`

Handoff 2 §4a: the "Offices" `<details>` group of kicker-labeled office blocks.

```js
renderOfficeGroup({
  label: "Offices",                      // summary text
  open: true,                            // explicit force-open; default closed (§5d, as above)
  offices: [{
    label: "District Office",            // uppercase kicker
    lines: ["116 N. Chicago Street, Suite 201, Joliet, IL 60432"],  // address lines
    phone: "630-549-2190"                // optional; rendered per rule 4
  }, { label: "D.C. Office", lines: ["2228 Rayburn HOB, Washington, DC 20515"],
       phone: "202-225-2976" }]
})
```

Callers keep using `officeAddressForGeocode` for the POI pin — unchanged.

### `renderNearestRows(items)`

Handoff 2 §4d + Handoff 3 §8a: nearest-N rows with distance pills.

```js
renderNearestRows([{
  name: "Naperville PD — Main Station",  // 14px/700
  note: "1350 Aurora Ave, Naperville",   // optional address line
  tag: { text: "High · 9–12",            // optional colored 600-weight lead on the
         color: "#0F6F6F" },             //   note line (§8a school type + grade range)
  dotColor: "#0F6F6F",                   // optional identity dot ahead of the name
  accentColor: "#0F6F6F",                // optional: tints the distance pill (color +
                                         //   10% background wash)
  distanceLabel: "1.8 mi"                // caller-formatted (factory owns rounding/units)
}])
```

### `registerNearestPointLayer(opts)`: the distance ceiling

The factory that calls `renderNearestRows` drops every point farther than a
ceiling before it ranks, and returns `null` when nothing is left, so the shell
renders the empty state (4e) with the layer's own sentence instead of a
distant facility with a distance pill. Added 2026-09-18, after a click far
outside a city instance's data returned that city's own facilities hundreds of
miles away.

- **Ceiling.** `opts.maxMiles` for one layer; else the instance's
  `NEAREST_MAX_MILES` from its METRO config block, read under a `typeof`
  guard (no instance declared one on 2026-09-18); else the engine default of
  **55 miles**. The default is the smallest multiple of 5 that exceeds every
  nearest-1 distance measured on 2026-09-18 across the fleet's nearest
  layers by at least 25 percent, so no card that answered correctly that day
  goes empty. The per-layer maxima and the method are in the block's own
  comment (`engine/index.html/nearest-point-factory.txt`); the largest,
  Michigan's police-station layer at 43.97 miles on Drummond Island, set it.
  `opts.maxMiles` narrows the ceiling; it is the place to tighten a city
  instance whose points stop at the city line.
- **Empty sentence.** `opts.emptyNote`; else
  `"No <label> within <ceiling> miles of this point."` with the label
  lower-cased, an all-capitals word such as EMS kept as written, so
  Michigan's fire card reads "No fire & EMS station within 55 miles of this
  point." The framework's default sentence is about districts and is wrong
  for a nearest layer.
- `distanceLabel` formatting, the `seq` guard and `coverage` are unchanged.

### `renderLinkRow(spec)`

Handoff 2 §4c: a name + link line (link-only cards; also the migration target
for `renderSourceUnavailable`'s lookup row).

```js
renderLinkRow({
  title: "Naperville Fire Protection District",   // optional 14.5px/700 line
  links: [{ label: "Official website ↗", url: "https://…" }]
})
```

### `cardTitleCase(str)` / `cardGradeRange(str)` (Handoff 3 §6a)

Display formatters for raw feed strings — pure string→string, no DOM.

- `cardTitleCase("700 S STATE ST")` → `"700 S State St"`. Normalizes
  ALL-CAPS feed text; single letters (grid directionals), digit-carrying
  tokens, and a small keep-caps set (`ES/MS/HS/PS/IS`, `NE/NW/SE/SW`,
  `IL/NY/CA/US`) pass through untouched. Never expands abbreviations —
  that would be guessing (honesty rules).
- `cardGradeRange("PK, K, 1, …, 8")` → `"PK–8"`. Collapses a **contiguous**
  comma-separated grade list to a range; a gapped or unrecognized list
  renders unchanged — never imply coverage the data doesn't state.
- `school-zone-factory` applies both via its `titleCaseData: true` opt
  (set by feeds that arrive ALL-CAPS, e.g. Chicago's `registerCpsZone`):
  name/address are title-cased and the collapsed grade range becomes the
  header identifier pill instead of a body note.

## `registerLayer` contract additions (all optional, presence-based)

No `cardV2` flag: a layer opts into each new surface by declaring the field,
which keeps unmigrated modules — and whole unmigrated forks — pixel-identical
in behavior to today.

- **`cardIdentifier(result) => string | null`** — the header identifier pill
  ("District 6", "IL‑14"). Rendered by the shell into the header on each
  result, cleared on empty/error. Factories derive it from the same district
  extraction their `hoverName`/card already use, so the three surfaces
  (pill, hover, card) cannot disagree.
- **`primaryLink(result) => {label, url} | null`** — the footer's right-aligned
  link ("Official directory ↗"). The **footer is shell-owned, not a helper**:
  when a result renders, the shell builds the footer from `primaryLink` plus
  the existing "Pin as parent" control (`appendPinControl` moves its button
  into the footer when one exists; its polygon-only/containment rules are
  unchanged). No `primaryLink` and no pin ⇒ no footer, as in Handoff 2 §4d.
- **`compact: true`** — Handoff 2 §4b single-row presentation. The shell
  renders the header as the two-line stack (small layer name over
  `cardIdentifier(result)` as the value line) with
  **`cardMeta(result) => string | null`** right-aligned muted (GEOID). A
  compact layer's `render` is not called on success; loading/error/empty
  states still use the normal body. Richer-data cases (the County card's
  clerk block) simply don't declare `compact` and use person rows instead.

## Shell and CSS changes (engine-side, no API surface)

- **Card chrome** (left accent, radius 10, shadow, restyled header) and the
  **4e states** (spinner row, error accent `#c2410c` + Retry, empty accent
  `#d1d5db`) ship for **all** cards at release N, migrated or not. Legacy
  `dt`/`dd` bodies inside the new chrome read like the handoff's 1d
  "directory table" during the transition — coherent, just not final.
- The redesign's palette lands as engine CSS custom properties (extending the
  existing `--slate`-family tokens) with the handoff hex values; layer theme
  colors stay per-metro config (the color dot keeps each layer's existing
  color, per Handoff 2).
- Mobile deltas (Handoff 1 §mobile) via a container query on the results panel
  at ~420px, applying to all helper-emitted classes; no API impact.
- `renderSourceUnavailable` (engine) migrates off `renderFieldList` to
  `renderLinkRow` in the same release.
- Hover popups, `hoverName`, `pointOfInterest`, coverage, and the
  stale-`seq` guard are untouched.

## Pattern → caller mapping

| Handoff pattern | Helpers | Callers (engine) | Callers (fork-local, per fork) |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 member roster | `renderBodyIntro` + `renderPersonRows` + `renderSectionLabel` | — | county-board dispatcher entries, ccbr, school-board, ccpsa, ward, il-supreme-court, county (clerk block) |
| 4a representative | person row + `renderOfficeGroup` | `chamber-factory` (congress, il-senate, il-house) | police-district (commander + station), police-beat |
| 4b name-only | *(contract fields only: `compact`, `cardIdentifier`, `cardMeta`)* | `polygon-factory`, `school-zone-factory`, `cps-network-factory` | ward-precinct, county-precinct (+ polling-place row via person/link rows), school-site |
| 4c link-only | `renderLinkRow` | — | fire/park/library districts, judicial-subcircuit, mwrd, tif, dupage-special-police |
| 4d nearest-N | `renderNearestRows` | `nearest-point-factory` | early-voting (bespoke); school-site (8a/8b chips card: tag/dot/accent slots) |
| 4e states | *(shell-owned)* | all layers automatically | — |

## Sequencing (per `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md`)

1. **Engine release N (additive):** `card-helpers` fence + CSS + shell changes
   (chrome, states, pill/footer/compact mounts) + factory migrations +
   `renderSourceUnavailable` migration. `renderFieldList` and `.result-row`
   CSS remain. At each fork's bump, chrome/states/factory-driven cards restyle
   immediately; fork-local cards keep `dt`/`dd` bodies inside the new chrome.
2. **Per-fork migration:** each fork moves its local `render` functions to the
   helpers at its own pace (Chicago in the same change-set that ships N).
3. **Engine release N+1 (retirement) — shipped as engine-v1.0.13:** once a
   fleet-wide grep showed zero `renderFieldList` call sites (the ENGINE_SYNC
   "definition of done" gate), the `renderFieldList` body, the
   `.result-row`/`.result-fields` CSS, the factories' legacy caller-HTML
   branches, and the debug-namespace export were removed. The `render-helper`
   fence itself is **emptied to a tombstone comment, not deleted** — the
   artifact builder rejects an empty fence and a fence-set change would force
   sibling pre-clean PRs; see `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md` item 13 for why this is the
   fleet convention.

**Gates, all local:** `python3 scripts/check_engine_parity.py index.html`
(fence lint; also runs inside `validate_index.py`), `validate_index.py`
(`registerLayer(` count is unchanged — this is a render-path change, not a
layer change), and the smoke test (boot + all layers + ground-truth
classification are DOM-shape-independent; extend it with a
new-class assertion once cards migrate).

## Open questions for review

1. **Chrome-for-all at release N** (recommended above) vs. chrome gated to
   migrated layers — mixed chrome within one panel looks broken, which is why
   all-at-once is recommended, but it does restyle sibling forks at bump time
   ahead of their content migration.
2. **`detailsOpen` render-time width check** — accepted staleness on resize,
   or listen and re-render? (Recommend: accept; re-render already happens per
   selection.)
3. **Distance pill formatting** — caller-formatted `distanceLabel` (above)
   keeps `toFixed` in the factory; alternatively pass raw miles and let the
   helper own rounding fleet-wide. Caller-formatted is recommended so bespoke
   nearest lists (early-voting) stay free to annotate.
