**Repo:** ThursdaysFamous/DistrictExplorer · **Date:** 2026-07-09 · **Scope:** `index.html` (2,811 lines, 1.30 MB), `sw.js`, `scripts/` pipeline, `.github/workflows/`

> **2026-07-16 · Round 2 re-analysis.** The app was re-measured at **33 layers** through three lenses — a Chrome DevTools-Protocol harness (`scripts/perf_profile.mjs`), the **production PageSpeed Insights mobile** run, and a **production Firefox Profiler capture** — written up in `docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_2026-07.md`. The 2026-07-09 campaign below shipped the compute + payload wins and **they hold** (production mobile: TBT 0 ms, CLS 0, A11y/BP/SEO 100, 0 boot long tasks). But production mobile **Performance is 75**, and the entire gap is **FCP 3.3 s + LCP 5.0 s** — *load delivery*, dominated by render-blocking third parties, which this (payload-size-focused, sandboxed) 2026-07-09 analysis never saw. The re-prioritized work — plus **two items rejected below as "unmeasured" (P9, P10) that are now measured** — is **[§6 Round 2](#6-round-2--the-load-delivery-campaign-2026-07-16)** at the end of this doc. Read §6 first for current priorities; §1–§5 are the 2026-07-09 record.

**Constraint changes this playbook is built on** (owner decisions, 2026-07-09):
- The Capacitor/Android/iOS stack is **removed** (done in this PR — 80 files, −2,931 lines; git history retains everything). The app is a website (+ installable PWA) only.
- The app is hosted (GitHub Pages, `ChiDistricts.overberg.co`); **`file://` support is no longer a constraint.** Every "embedded inline because file:// blocks sibling fetches" decision in the codebase is now renegotiable. The other design values — one hand-readable page, no build step, no framework, per-layer failure isolation, sanitized external strings, never-guess/never-stale officeholder data — remain in force and this playbook works within them.

All numbers were measured against this working tree unless marked *(not live-verified)* — the same convention the codebase itself uses. Findings were produced by a multi-agent review (5 scoped reviewers + adversarial verification of all 36 findings + a completeness-critic round that added 19 more); everything below survived verification, and the biggest claims were re-derived independently a second time.

**Execution log (this PR):** Matrix items **1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 shipped** (plus the geocoder-submit debounce fix) — school-board geometry simplified, CI validation gate added, service worker switched to network-first, remote Esri loaders made leaner + more resilient, and the Nominatim/geocoder paths made polite.
- **Item 1 correction:** the plan below (and QW1) originally proposed per-ring Douglas-Peucker simplification. Executing it revealed that per-ring DP is **not topology-aware** — at ~3.3 m tolerance it produced an *overlap* (a point landing in two districts), which is unacceptable for a "which district contains you" coverage. The shipped implementation uses **topology-aware mapshaper** (Visvalingam, keep-shapes, 15% retain, 6-decimal precision) — the same tool the sibling layers used — via the new reproducible `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py`. Result: the embedded blob 975,796 → **83,470 B**; `index.html` 1,301,984 → **409,712 B raw / 112,216 B gzip (−69% raw, −74% gzip)**; validated through the app's *own* extracted point-in-polygon functions: **2000/2000 on the repo's protocol, 0 topology breaks, 0 internal wrong-district misses, 20/20 district interiors correct**. (The all-embedded-data externalization to `data/app/*.json`, item 2/P0, is the larger separate follow-up and is *not* in this PR.)
- **Item 3:** `scripts/validate_index.py` (node --check + registerLayer floor + embedded-blob round-trip + rewrite-target presence), wired into both roster workflows between the rewrite and the PR; tested against a simulated module-deletion and a corrupted-blob.
- **Item 4:** `sw.js` fetch handler is now network-first with cache fallback.
- **Items 9/10/11 (remote-loader resilience):** `loadTigerLayer`, `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON`, and `loadArcGISGeoJSON` now request `geometryPrecision=6` (~0.11 m; trims coordinate payload, ignored by servers that don't support it). The two big statewide loaders (`loadTigerLayer`, `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON`) gained the `hasUsableGeometry` guard the Socrata/CPD loaders already had — an Esri HTTP-200-with-error-envelope no longer gets cached as a permanent session-long success — and a 30 s per-attempt timeout (shared `REMOTE_GEOJSON_TIMEOUT_MS`) so their whole-boundary payloads can finish on a slow link instead of aborting at 9 s. `outFields=*` was deliberately kept (not trimmed) to preserve `extractDistrictNumber`'s name-field fallback across TIGERweb's per-Congress field renames. Guard verified against realistic error-envelope/empty/null-geometry/valid inputs through the app's own `hasUsableGeometry`.
- **Items 14/15 + geocoder fix (Nominatim politeness):** added `preconnect` for the Leaflet CDN and two tile shards + `dns-prefetch` for the click-time data/geocoder APIs. POI geocoding now flows through a serial, ≥1 s-spaced queue (`enqueuePoiGeocode`) instead of firing up to 9 parallel requests per click at Nominatim's 1-req/s endpoint; a per-call currency check skips the network once the selection moves on, so rapid clicking can't build an unbounded backlog, and the existing per-address cache still short-circuits repeats. The search-box submit handler now `clearTimeout`s the pending input-debounce so an Enter press within 550 ms of typing no longer fires a request the debounce then aborts and duplicates. Queue verified to run serially at ~1 s spacing with in-order results.

**Execution log (PR-D — externalization):** Matrix items **2, 6, 26 shipped** together (item 6 is a hard dependency of item 2 — the roster builders had to stop rewriting the now-removed HTML blocks).
- **Item 2 (P0):** all seven embedded datasets moved to `data/app/*.json` — three boundary geometries (`school-board-districts`, `il-supreme-court-districts`, `ccbr-districts`) and four rosters (`il-senate-members`, `il-house-members`, `school-board-members`, `cpd-district-info`), extracted verbatim so geometry classification is byte-identical. Each loader now `fetchJSONWithRetry`s its file lazily on first toggle via the existing cached-loader machinery; geometry failures surface the per-layer error card + Retry, while the enrichment rosters join best-effort (`Promise.all` + `.catch(() => {})`) so a roster outage degrades to "district number + official link" instead of blanking the card. `index.html` **409,777 → 111,811 B (−73%)**. Verified end-to-end in real Chromium: the three offline layers classify correctly (school-board D12/6b → *Jessica Biggs*, supreme-court D1, board-of-review D3), the roster joins resolve (senate D5 → *Lakesia Collins*, house D40 → *Jaime Andrade Jr.*), and a forced roster-fetch failure degrades gracefully.
- **Item 6:** `build_il_roster.py` / `build_cpd_roster.py` now `json.dump` to `data/app/` instead of regex-splicing `index.html` — the DOTALL over-match risk, the `</script`-escaping and the (previously no-op) U+2028/U+2029 escaping all cease to exist. `build_embedded_boundaries.py` writes `data/app/school-board-districts.json`; `validate_index.py` was repurposed to gate the app + data files (no inline blobs remain, every `data/app` file present and well formed) and both weekly workflows now build/commit the JSON files.
- **Item 26:** README updated (embedded→fetched, offline/SW-caching semantics, `data/app/` simplification provenance, repo layout); the not-in-repo Playwright/parse5 Validation claim was replaced with the real `validate_index.py` gate (the smoke test itself remains item 5).
- **Deliberately not folded in:** SW shell-entry dedupe (item 22) and the `timeoutMs` overrides for the now-fetched large geometry (item 11) — `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME` was bumped to `-v2` and given cache-first geometry / network-first roster handling for `data/app/*`, but the pre-existing `"./"`+`"./index.html"` duplication is left for item 22.

**Execution log (item 5 — smoke test):** Committed `scripts/smoke_test.mjs` (Playwright) + `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml` (`on: pull_request`), delivering the headless boot check the README described but the repo never carried (R4 doc/reality drift). Eight checks, all deterministic — no dependency on the live district APIs (flaky in CI): app boots and exports `window.ChiExplorer`, all **18** layers register, the three no-API layers classify the downtown Loop point against known ground truth (school-board 12, IL Supreme Court 1, Board of Review 3) including the member-roster join, and a forced `data/app` failure yields an isolated error card + Retry. Verified green locally against the real page. This also gives the externalization PR its first real CI (the roster workflows are schedule/dispatch-only and never ran on PRs). *(One CI-side subtlety worth recording: the app's service worker serves `data/app/*` cache-first and its requests aren't interceptable by Playwright's `page.route`, so the failure-injection check runs with `serviceWorkers: "block"`.)*

**Execution log (item 7 — surface silent overlay-load failures):** `onLayerToggled`'s overlay-load `catch` previously only `console.error`'d; before a point is picked `runLayerQuery` returns early, so a failed boundary download was completely invisible (silent stall up to ~28 s). It now calls `setCardError` (guarded on the layer still being on), which drops the card's `state-off` `display:none` so the error shows right under the toggle, with a Retry that re-runs `onLayerToggled` → re-attempts the load. A ninth smoke check covers it (toggle a layer via permalink with no point, fail its fetch, assert a visible error card + Retry). *Remaining, out of scope for this item:* the second-order gap R5 notes — if the user skips Retry and just selects a point, a now-succeeding `query()` renders the answer but the map overlay isn't rebuilt (boundaries stay undrawn). Tracked as a follow-up; the Retry path already gives the user a way to get boundaries back.

**Execution log (item 12 — click-path rendering, P7):** the per-click point-in-polygon + restyle cost was halved-then-collapsed. `findFeatureContaining` now memoizes its `(point → feature)` scan on the geojson object (keyed by point-object identity, which `setSelectedPoint` mints fresh per selection), so the second scan a click always did — once in the layer's `query()`, once in `updateLayerHighlight()` against the same cached geojson — is now a free cache hit instead of a full re-sweep. `updateLayerHighlight` gained an incremental fast path: it records whether a highlight is applied and a signature of the inputs the faded/base styles depend on (active-layer count + outline mode); when that signature is unchanged and the layer is already highlighted, a point move flips only the two paths whose role changed (old match → faded, new match → highlight) and leaves every other path's DOM untouched — turning the common "same layers on, new point" case from ~N `setStyle` calls (the measured dominant per-click cost) into 2. Any signature change (a layer toggled on/off, `outlineOnly` flipped) falls back to the existing full sweep, and `clearLayerHighlight` resets the bookkeeping so the next highlight rebuilds from scratch. No layer-module changes — purely the shared highlight code. `setSelectedPoint` was exposed on the `window.ChiExplorer` debug namespace so the behaviour is drivable. Verified in real Chromium (Leaflet vendored locally to bypass the sandbox's CDN egress block): with school-board + IL-Supreme-Court on, moving the selection Loop → (41.99,-87.66) → Loop → outside-all-districts re-classifies correctly each hop (school-board D12 ⇄ D4 with its roster re-joining — *Jessica Biggs* ⇄ *Debby Pope* — while IL Supreme Court holds D1), each layer keeps its own independent highlight through the moves, and a point outside a layer's coverage clears just that layer's highlight. A new smoke check (`scripts/smoke_test.mjs`, point move → District 4 + a visible highlight) exercises the incremental path in CI.

**Execution log (item 16 — tile-failure banner, R6):** the base map is CDN-served while the app itself boots and stays usable offline (SW shell + same-origin `data/app`), so a tile outage previously left a silently gray map. The CARTO basemap layer is now held in a `baseTiles` var driving a dismissible bottom-center banner ("Base map tiles unavailable — your selections and layers still work.") — originally a `tileerror`/`tileload` pair on the raster tile layer; since the 2026-08 vector-basemap change that pair survives on the raster *fallback* while the primary MapLibre GL path drives the same banner from `error`/`sourcedata` events, with a pre-style-arrival failure skipping the debounce (one failed `style.json` is the whole basemap, not one tile of many — see the `basemap` ENGINE block). It's **debounced** — the banner surfaces only after ≥4 tile errors inside a rolling 4 s window (a single transient tile hiccup can't flash it) and hides again the moment any tile loads (the CDN recovered); manual dismiss latches for the session. No new dependency, styled with the existing design tokens (`--warn` accent). Verified in real Chromium with the tile CDN stubbed to 503: banner appears on outage, stays hidden after dismiss, and never appears when tiles load. A fifth smoke check (`scripts/smoke_test.mjs`, tile CDN → 503, assert banner shown then dismissed) covers it in CI. *(Note: the tile host is `a.basemaps.cartocdn.com` — a dot, not a slash, before `basemaps` — so the interception must be a regex, not a `**/basemaps…` glob; recorded in the test.)*

**Execution log (item 22 — SW shell dedupe + cache discipline + font trim, P13/P-sw):** `sw.js` precached both `"./"` and `"./index.html"` — two Cache API keys holding the identical ~112 KB-gzip page, downloaded twice at install. Dropped the `"./index.html"` entry and added a **navigate-request branch** to the fetch handler: page navigations go network-first, falling back offline to the cached canonical `"./"` shell — so the manifest's `start_url: ./index.html` and any deep `/index.html` bookmark still boot offline from one stored copy. `CACHE_NAME` bumped `-v2 → -v3` (the activate handler reclaims the old cache), with a comment codifying the rule: bump it whenever any `*_URLS` list changes so a removed entry can't live forever. Verified with the real SW registered: precache holds `"./"` (not `/index.html`) + the three geometry files, and **offline navigation to both `/index.html` and `/` serves the shell (HTTP 200, map + title present)**. Font trim: dropped Big Shoulders Display 700 (verified: no display-font element requests it). **Kept Inter 700** — the playbook's "no `<strong>`/`<b>`" premise has since drifted; the footer disclaimer, verified-date, and pinned-parent legend now use `<strong>`/`<b>` (weight 700 via the UA default, no CSS reset), so dropping Inter 700 would have faux-bolded real UI.

**Execution log (item 20 — loader/route-walker consolidation, R7/R8):** two pairs of duplicated machinery collapsed, no behaviour change. **R7:** `makeCached` and `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` were byte-identical cached-promise factories (an in-flight/cached promise per loader, cleared on rejection so a Retry re-fetches); kept the single well-documented `makeCached` and repointed the five `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` call sites + the `makeCachedLoader` wrapper to it (they already relied on the function-declaration hoisting the codebase uses throughout). **R8:** `loadSocrataGeoJSON` and `loadSocrataJSON` were 18-line structural clones of the same fallback-route walker — including the single-catch-per-route subtlety that fixed a real double-execution bug (a `.then`-recursion + `.catch`-recursion pair that re-ran later routes twice). Extracted one `tryRoutes(urls, validate, label)`; the geometry loader passes `hasUsableGeometry`, the rows loader passes an `Array.isArray(rows) && rows.length` check. Net −17 lines. Verified: static gate green; a standalone unit test of the extracted walker confirms it tries each route exactly once with the right retry counts (primary 2, fallbacks 1), advances past both a failed fetch and a "200-but-useless" response, and rejects when all routes fail; the app boots with all 22 layers and the `makeCached`-backed school-board layer still classifies the Loop point to District 12 with no page errors.

**Execution log (item 21 — declarative `registerPolygonLayer`, R9):** added a factory that builds both `query()` and `render()` from a declarative `fields` list — each field is a keyed lookup (`findPropCI`, with a `primary` headline that falls back to "Unknown"), a fixed text row, or a fixed html row, with an optional `when(result)` predicate to gate a row on the extracted values. Converted the four layers that are genuinely *pure single-source polygons* — **Community Area, ZIP Code, IL Supreme Court, Board of Review** — onto it. *Scope honesty:* R9's "~250 lines / most of the nine" estimate was optimistic — a close read shows the other standalone polygon blocks all carry an async `Promise.all` join or second concern (Police District: commander roster + station-view address/phone + `onToggle` cascade; Ward: aldermen roster + precinct sub-layer; CCPSA: council roster; Congress: `congress-roster.json`; Commissioner: Cook County electedOfficials table; plus the point/nearest-N and sub-layer modules), none of which fits a pure-polygon factory without an `enrich` hook that would make it a leaky, largely-CI-unverifiable abstraction. Those keep their explicit blocks. So the raw line count is ~flat (the factory's doc comment offsets the four blocks' savings); the win is that the four now share one query/render implementation and new pure layers register in a single declarative block. `validate_index.py`'s `registerLayer(` floor comment was refreshed (now 1 def + 11 direct + 4 factory bodies = 16; the runtime still registers 22). **Verified in real Chromium:** IL Supreme Court → D1 (with the District-1 note) and Board of Review → D3 against the offline ground truth, Community Area and ZIP against stubbed Socrata geometry (`Name TEST AREA` / `Area # 77`, `ZIP Code 60601`), and the fallback branch (empty props → `Name Unknown`, the optional `Area #` row correctly omitted) — every factory branch (primary/optional/static-text/static-html/`when`) exercised, 22 layers still register, no page errors.

**Execution log (item 19 — no more duplicate weekly roster PRs, R10):** each of the four roster workflows (`update-{ilga,congress,cpd,ccpsa}-roster.yml`) opened its PR from a per-run branch `bot/<name>-roster-update-${{ github.run_id }}`, so an unmerged roster PR spawned a brand-new duplicate every week. Switched each to a **fixed branch** `bot/<name>-roster-update`, **force-push** it, and guard `gh pr create` behind `gh pr list --head "$branch" --state open` — so a re-run refreshes the existing PR in place (and, incidentally, no longer errors on the "a PR already exists for this branch" create). When no open PR exists (first run, or the previous one merged/closed) it still opens a fresh one. The scraper-dep pinning half of R10 was already shipped earlier (`scripts/requirements.txt`; the ILGA/CCPSA jobs `pip install -c` it, CPD `-r` it with Playwright, congress is stdlib-only). YAML validated; the roster jobs are schedule/dispatch-only so this was verified by inspection + parse rather than a live run (dispatching would open real officeholder PRs).

**Execution log (item 18 — `.nojekyll`, R10, partial):** added an empty `.nojekyll` at the repo root so the classic branch Pages deploy skips the Jekyll build step entirely. No file is corrupted today (no `{{`/`{%` in `index.html`/`sw.js`/`manifest.webmanifest`, no leading-`_`/`.` served paths), but this future-proofs the served page against any Liquid-looking sequence a JS template literal might later introduce, and shaves the Jekyll pass off every deploy — zero risk. **Deliberately not done:** the Actions-based Pages deploy that uploads only the app files (excluding `data/source/raw/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`) — that requires flipping the repo's Pages *source* from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions" (a Settings change outside the tree) and is outward-facing (a misconfiguration takes the live site down), so it's left for an owner decision.

**Execution log (item 18 — Actions-based Pages deploy, R10, remaining half):** added `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. It assembles a curated `_site` (via `rsync` with an explicit exclude list) holding **only** the files the app serves at runtime and uploads that as the Pages artifact — verified published set: `index.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `CNAME`, `.nojekyll`, `icons/icon-{192,512}.png`, all nine `data/app/*.json`, plus the harmless `README.md`/`.gitignore`. **Dropped from the CDN:** `scripts/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and ~5 MB of build-only geometry — `data/source/` (raw zips/xlsx) and the three full-precision `data/*.geojson` originals that `data/app/*.json` is simplified from (none of which is ever fetched at runtime). The custom domain is preserved by shipping `CNAME` in the artifact; `permissions` is the least-privilege `pages: write` + `id-token: write`; `concurrency: {group: pages, cancel-in-progress: false}` avoids half-published deploys. The exclude set was validated by simulating it against `git ls-files` (all 7 core runtime files + 9 `data/app` files present; zero heavy/build paths leaked). **Still an owner action (documented in the workflow header):** the workflow only takes effect once the repo's Pages *source* is flipped Settings → Pages → "Deploy from a branch" → "GitHub Actions". Until the flip, the classic branch deploy stays authoritative and keeps the live site up (no outage window — adding the workflow does not change the Pages source), and this job's final `deploy-pages` step will fail harmlessly on pushes to `main`; after the flip it becomes the deploy path. Not run here — it triggers on push to `main`/dispatch only, and the deploy can't be exercised from a feature branch without the settings change.

**Execution log (item 17 — toggle-path opacity rescale, P8):** toggling a layer on/off changes the active-layer count, which used to force `refreshActiveLayerOpacities` to re-run the *full* `updateLayerHighlight` (point-in-polygon + full restyle sweep + class ops) for **every** active layer — even though the only thing a count change affects is how translucent each layer's flat fill is (`scaledFillOpacity`). Replaced that with `rescaleLayerFill(mod)`: a layer that's already showing a selection highlight has fixed, count-independent faded/highlight fill opacities, so it needs **no restyle at all** (its stored `highlightSignature` is just refreshed so the next point move still takes the P7 fast path); a layer with no active highlight gets a single `setStyle({fillOpacity})` per path instead of the full recomputation. The active-count signature the P7 fast path keys on was extracted into one `highlightSignature(rt)` helper (used by both `updateLayerHighlight` and the rescale) so the two can't drift. Also dropped the `reorderActiveLayers()` call from the toggle-**off** branch: removing one layer leaves the survivors' relative z-order — already established by the stacking invariant — untouched, and no `onToggle(false)` cascade turns another layer *on* (verified: police-district/beat and ward/precinct cascades only turn things off), so there's nothing to restack (toggle-on and query-resolve still reorder, since those insert a layer that must land at its size rank). No layer-module changes. Verified in real Chromium (Leaflet vendored locally): with all three offline layers on and a point selected, toggling Board of Review off drops exactly its one highlight and leaves school-board + IL-Supreme-Court lit (3 → 2), and re-toggling returns to 3 — i.e. the rescale never disturbs the other layers' matched regions. A new smoke check (`scripts/smoke_test.mjs`, before/afterOff/afterOn highlight counts) exercises this in CI; static gate green (16 `registerLayer(` calls).

**Execution log (item 23 — release the Leaflet layer graph on toggle-off, P11):** `onLayerToggled`'s off-branch used to `map.removeLayer(rt.overlayLayer)` but keep the Leaflet object forever — ~2 MB of `L.LatLng` objects for the biggest layer, retained unbounded across a long multi-layer session. It now nulls `rt.overlayLayer` after removing it; the **raw geojson (`rt.geojson`) stays cached**, so re-toggle rebuilds the layer from it *synchronously* (no refetch) via a new shared `buildOverlayLayer(mod, geojson)` helper — re-toggle stays instant and `query()`'s shared geojson is untouched (that cache is deliberate and unchanged). The toggle-on branch was restructured to three states: geometry cached → rebuild-and-attach synchronously (the P11 path); never loaded → fetch-build-attach (unchanged); fetch in-flight → wait (unchanged, `overlayLoaded` still guards duplicate loads). Verified in real Chromium via the existing toggle smoke check, which now also covers this: toggling Board of Review off nulls its overlay, and toggling back on rebuilds it from the cached geojson and re-highlights the matched region (3 → 2 → 3) — the highlight can only reappear if the rebuild produced a working, `eachLayer`-able overlay. All 12 smoke checks green; static gate green (16 `registerLayer(` calls). *(This item was P1's "nice when touching that code" follow-up; after the school-board simplification the per-layer footprint is ~10× smaller than the measured 2 MB, but the release is still correct hygiene and now that the toggle path was already open for P8 it was cheap to land.)*

**Matrix correction (item 8 — P2, congress roster): already shipped in a prior PR, matrix strike-through was missing.** `scripts/build_congress_roster.py`, `.github/workflows/update-congress-roster.yml`, and `data/app/congress-roster.json` (IL's 17 U.S. House reps, ~2.4 KB) all exist; `index.html`'s congress layer now `fetchJSONWithRetry`s the same-origin roster instead of the multi-MB `unitedstates.github.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json`. The matrix row below is updated to reflect this.

**Pipeline validation run (2026-07-09):** every generator script and its workflow was exercised end-to-end against live sources to confirm each still produces the expected `data/app/*.json`. Results:

| Workflow / step | Scripts (in order) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `update-congress-roster` | `build_congress_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ✅ 17/17 IL U.S. House districts; byte-identical to the committed `congress-roster.json`; static gate green |
| `update-ilga-roster` | `ilga_scraper.py` (182 records, 0 errors) → `build_il_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ✅ 59 senate + 118 house; house byte-identical to committed, senate differs only by one member's district-office **address** (a real update — exactly what the weekly PR exists to surface); static gate green on the regenerated tree |
| `update-cpd-roster` | `cpd_district_scraper.py` → `build_cpd_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ❌ **scrape blocked** at the first fetch — see R11 |
| operator step | `build_embedded_boundaries.py school-board` | ✅ 3,525 coord pairs, 83,470 B; 2000/2000 agreement, 0 overlaps; byte-identical to committed |
| `smoke-test` (behaviour gate) | `scripts/smoke_test.mjs` | ⚠️ not exercisable in the review sandbox — Playwright's bundled Chromium can't reach the Leaflet CDN or the localhost server through the session's egress proxy (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` on cdnjs). It is a GitHub-hosted-runner gate with direct egress, recorded green there; **no code defect**, environmental only. |

**Redundant/orphaned-script review:** none found. All eight scripts are live — seven wired into the four workflows, plus `build_embedded_boundaries.py` as the documented occasional operator step (`README.md`, `index.html:2474`, this doc). The `fetch`/`clean`/`HEADERS` helpers duplicated across `ilga_scraper.py` and `cpd_district_scraper.py` are a deliberate keep-scripts-standalone choice (no shared module = no cross-script coupling in the heuristic scrapers), consistent with the no-build-step architecture; left as-is. *[Superseded 2026-08-24 for the machinery half — see §8; the heuristic-parser half stands.]*

## 1. Executive Summary

This is an unusually disciplined codebase: per-layer failure isolation is real, stale async results are sequenced away, external strings pass through one sanitizer, scrapers are polite and PR-gated, and design constraints are written down and mostly honored. The four issues that matter, in order:

1. **75% of the product is one unsimplified data blob — and the file:// rationale for embedding it just expired.** `SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON` (`index.html:2553`) is 975,796 bytes — a verbatim copy of `data/school-board-districts.geojson` at up to 15-decimal (sub-nanometer) precision, despite the README's claim that all embedded layers are mapshaper-simplified. Its two siblings actually were simplified (they're 10–15% of their source size). Simplifying it the same way (topology-aware mapshaper — **shipped in this PR**) cuts it to **83 KB (−91%)**, taking `index.html` from **1.30 MB → 410 KB raw (428 KB → 112 KB gzipped)** at 100% agreement on the repo's validation protocol with zero topology breaks. And now that `file://` is gone, all three geometry blobs plus the generated rosters can leave the page entirely — fetched lazily, per layer, on first toggle, through the cached-loader machinery that already exists. End state: `index.html` ≈ **165 KB raw / ~45 KB gzipped**, and a user who never toggles the school-board layer never downloads a byte of it.

2. **The weekly CI rewrite of a 1.3 MB file ships with zero output validation — and the rewrite mechanism can silently delete code.** Both roster workflows regex-rewrite `index.html` and open a PR with no check that the result still parses (`node --check` takes 44 ms). The lazy DOTALL regex in `replace_block` was shown, reproducibly, to be able to overmatch and delete 46 KB of live modules under plausible anchor drift; `build_cpd_roster.py`'s U+2028/U+2029 escaping is a confirmed silent no-op (it replaces the character with itself — drift from its `build_il_roster.py` original, which is correct); and the Playwright boot smoke-test the README describes as existing **is not in the repo** — it was designed and run once, then never committed. Externalizing generated data (unlocked by #1's constraint change) dissolves the regex risk entirely; the validation gap needs fixing either way.

3. **The service worker violates the project's own freshness rule.** `sw.js` serves the shell cache-first with background revalidation — but the rosters live *inside* that shell, so every returning visitor sees last-deploy's officeholders on a page whose header comment says staleness there is unacceptable. One small handler change (network-first with cache fallback) restores correct-when-online semantics.

4. **Silent failure paths and measured interaction waste.** Toggling a layer before selecting a point gives a completely silent failure on 15 of 18 layers if the boundary download fails (violates honesty rule 3); ArcGIS "200-with-error-envelope" responses get cached as permanent success on 4 layers; and every map click re-runs point-in-polygon twice per layer and restyles every SVG path of every active layer (~6,300 attribute mutations per click with 5 typical layers on).

## 2. Performance Optimization Plan

### 2.1 Payload & startup

**P0 — Externalize the embedded data; fetch lazily per layer** *(unlocked by the file:// constraint removal)*
`index.html` embeds 1,136,613 bytes of data across three geometry blobs (lines 2553/2620/2658: 975,796 + 99,810 + 61,009 B) and three generated rosters (`IL_SENATE_MEMBERS` 18,080 B, `IL_HOUSE_MEMBERS` 36,058 B, `CPD_DISTRICT_INFO` currently a 32-byte placeholder). Every visitor downloads and evaluates all of it (measured: ~38 ms script-eval for the JSON.parse lines on desktop Node, est. 150–300 ms on low-end mobile WebViews) even though all three geometry layers are off by default.

Move each dataset to `data/app/<name>.json`, and have the loaders fetch them with the machinery that already exists — this is a ~10-line change per layer because the cached-loader pattern is already promise-shaped:

```js
// before (index.html:2554-2556)
var loadSchoolBoardDistricts = makeCached(function () {
  return Promise.resolve(SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON);
});
// after
var loadSchoolBoardDistricts = makeCached(function () {
  return fetchJSONWithRetry("data/app/school-board-districts.json", {}, 2);
});
```

Effects: `index.html` drops to ~165 KB raw (~45 KB gzip); first paint stops paying for data; each dataset downloads only when its layer first toggles on, with the existing per-layer error card + Retry as the failure surface; the roster builder scripts stop rewriting HTML entirely (see R1); and same-origin fetches need no CORS. Two things to preserve deliberately: (a) the three formerly-embedded layers stop working *offline-first* unless the SW caches `data/app/*` — cache the **geometry** files cache-first (boundaries change ~once a decade) and the **roster** files network-first (same rule as R-sw below); (b) update the six now-obsolete "embedded inline (not fetched)" comments and the README's offline paragraph in the same PR.

**P1 — Simplify the school-board geometry regardless (measured: −918 KB raw standalone; −94% of the fetched file after P0).**
Whether embedded or externalized, the school-board geometry is 24,904 coordinate pairs at 14–15 decimals for 20 districts. Its siblings were topology-simplified to 4,771 and 2,916 pairs at 5 decimals (10.2%/14.4% keep — `index.html:2605-2619` documents the treatment and its 2,000-point validation; the README extends that claim, incorrectly, to all embedded layers). **Shipped** (see Execution log — the simplifier must be topology-aware; per-ring DP was found to create district overlaps):

| | Coord pairs | Bytes | index.html raw | index.html gzip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Coord pairs | Blob bytes | index.html raw | index.html gzip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Today | 24,904 | 975,796 | 1,301,984 | 427,836 |
| 6dp rounding only (topology-preserving, 100% agreement) | 24,904 | 570,353 | 896,595 | 233,544 |
| **Shipped:** mapshaper topology-aware + 6dp | 3,525 | 83,470 | 409,712 | 112,216 |

Validation of the shipped result, run through the app's *own* extracted `pointInGeometry`/`findFeatureContaining`: **2000/2000 on the repo's protocol** (100%); over 6,000 random points, **0 points in >1 district** (topology intact), **0 internal wrong-district misses**, and **all 20 district interiors correct** — the only stringent-test disagreement (~0.02%) is an outer-edge boundary point (in no district → district 1), below GPS error. Two options were rejected: **per-ring Douglas-Peucker** (the smaller ~58 KB it produces is *not topology-safe* — it created a district overlap at ~3.3 m, verified) and **6dp-rounding-only** (perfectly safe but only −45% gzip). mapshaper is the tool the sibling layers already used; regeneration is reproducible via `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py`.

### 2.2 Network

**P2 — Stop shipping the national congress roster to every browser.**
`index.html:2195-2197` fetches `https://unitedstates.github.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json` — all ~538 members with every term each has ever served, multi-MB raw *(not live-verified; sandbox egress blocked)* — then filters client-side (2218-2222) for one IL representative, using ≤ ~200 bytes of it. Verifier correction folded in: the browser HTTP cache does mitigate repeats (GitHub Pages serves ETag/max-age), so the cost is per cold cache, not per session — but the first toggle on any device still pays the full download. The repo already owns the right pattern: build-time roster embedding with a weekly PR-gated refresh (ILGA: 59+118 members; CPD: 22 districts). A `scripts/build_congress_roster.py` producing IL's 17 reps (~3–4 KB, becoming `data/app/congress-roster.json` after P0) removes the layer's runtime dependency on a third-party host entirely.

**P3 — Ask Esri servers for display-precision geometry.**
`loadTigerLayer` (`index.html:2115-2120`), `loadArcGISGeoJSON` (1607), and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2710-2711) all fetch full-precision coordinates with `outFields=*`. Adding `&geometryPrecision=6` (≈11 cm) cuts coordinate payload ~40% (measured proxy: digits beyond 6dp are 41.5% of raw GeoJSON bytes on the full-precision layer analyzed locally); servers that don't support the param ignore it. `outFields` can shrink to the fields actually read (`CONGRESS_DISTRICT_FIELDS` at 2198, `districtFields` at 2534, commissioner fields at 2725). Six layers benefit (congress, il-senate, il-house, police-district, police-station, commissioner). Exact diff in §5 QW4.

**P4 — Give big payloads a bigger timeout than a 1-row probe.**
`fetchJSONWithRetry` supports `opts.timeoutMs` (`index.html:711`) but none of the 9 call sites overrides it — a 9 s whole-body budget applies equally to a 1-row Socrata probe and the statewide IL House boundary download, so slow links can *never* load the big layers (each retry re-aborts at 9 s), while the Socrata 3-route ladder can keep a "Loading…" spinner alive ~65 s before failing. Give the known-large loaders (TIGERweb, Cook County, ArcGIS, congress roster until P2) `{timeoutMs: 30000}` and consider dropping route-ladder retries to tighten worst-case failure to under ~30 s.

**P5 — Guard the two unguarded Esri loaders (a 200-response bug becomes a session-long outage).**
ArcGIS REST returns HTTP 200 with a JSON error envelope under load — the exact "succeeded but useless" mode the code already defends against for Socrata (`hasUsableGeometry` at 1566) and CPD ArcGIS (1610). `loadTigerLayer` (2119) and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2712) skip the guard, and `makeCached` retains resolved promises forever — so one bad 200 kills congress/il-senate/il-house/commissioner for the whole session with no Retry path. Two one-line `.then` additions reusing the existing guard.

**P6 — Serialize POI geocoding (up to 9 concurrent Nominatim hits per click today).**
9 of 18 layers define `pointOfInterest`; a click with them active fires up to 9 parallel `geocodePoiAddress` requests (18 with retries) at a shared public service with a 1 req/s policy — the *search* geocoder respects it (550 ms debounce, comment at 1036), the POI path doesn't. The per-address cache (`poiGeocodeCache`, 1250) already prevents repeats; add a small promise queue with ≥1 s spacing in front of the fetch (pins already appear asynchronously, so latency is tolerable).

### 2.3 Interaction & rendering

**P7 — One PIP scan and two path restyles per click, not two scans and ~630 restyles.**
Measured today (5 typical layers on: community areas 77, ZIPs ~61, wards 50, police 22, school zones ~420): every click runs `findFeatureContaining` **twice** per layer (once in `mod.query`, again in `updateLayerHighlight` at 1218 on the same cached geojson) and then `eachLayer`+`setStyle` over *every* sub-layer (1223-1234) — ~630 `setStyle` × ~10 attributes ≈ 6,300 SVG attribute mutations + 630 classList ops per click. Fix in the shared code, no module changes: (a) memoize `(point → feature)` on the geojson object so query and highlight share one scan; (b) when only the selection moved, restyle just the previous match and the new match — the faded/base style of the other ~628 paths is unchanged unless the *active-layer count* changed; (c) optional: per-feature bbox pre-check (0.105 ms → 0.004 ms per school-board scan, measured).

**P8 — Toggle path does the same full sweep, plus a DOM reorder of every path.**
`onLayerToggled` → `refreshActiveLayerOpacities` re-runs `updateLayerHighlight` (full PIP + full restyle) for every active layer, then `reorderActiveLayers` `bringToFront()`s each layer (~630 `appendChild`s) — including on toggle-**off** (1401-1402), where the layer being removed doesn't need restyling at all. Opacity rescaling only needs `setStyle({fillOpacity})` per path, not the full highlight recomputation; and the highlight of *other* layers is unaffected by a toggle.

**P9 — The highlight drop-shadow is a hidden rasterization tax.**
`.chi-region-highlight` (`index.html:525-528`) applies stacked `drop-shadow()` filters to a raw SVG path; at z15 the largest highlighted district's filter region is ~13.9 Mpx, re-rasterized during pan/zoom. Cheapest fix if pan jank is observed on low-end devices: drop the filter during `movestart`/`moveend`, or trade the shadow for a non-filter treatment (wider casing stroke). Cosmetic decision — flagging the mechanism so it's a choice.

**P10 — Canvas rendering for the many-polygon layers — with a named trade-off.**
No `renderer`/`preferCanvas` option exists in the file; all ~1,000 polygons (all layers on) are SVG DOM paths, ~500 of them from the school-zone layers. Per-layer `renderer: L.canvas()` on the three school-zone + two CPS-network layers would remove most paths — **but** the highlight mechanism mutates `subLayer._path.classList` (1226-1229), which doesn't exist under canvas, so the drop-shadow highlight would need the setStyle-only fallback on those layers. Do after P7/P8; only if profiling still shows restyle cost.

**P11 — Release the Leaflet layer graph on toggle-off (keep the geojson).**
Toggle-off keeps `rt.overlayLayer` forever — ~2 MB of `L.LatLng` objects for school-board alone (measured), unbounded across an 18-layer session. Keep the raw-geojson promise caches (they're what make re-toggle instant and are shared with `query()` — verified deliberate), but null out the Leaflet object on toggle-off and rebuild from `rt.geojson` on re-toggle. After P1's simplification this shrinks ~10×, so it's a "nice when touching that code" item.

### 2.4 Delivery & caching

**P-sw — `sw.js` currently guarantees stale rosters for returning visitors — invert the shell strategy.**
The shell (which *contains* the rosters until P0) is served cache-first with background revalidation (`sw.js:49-62`), so every visit after a roster deploy shows the previous roster — directly against the never-stale rule in the file's own header. Network-first with cache fallback restores plain-page-load semantics online and keeps offline boot. Exact diff in §5 QW2. Post-P0 the same policy question moves to `data/app/*`: geometry cache-first, rosters network-first. Also: drop the duplicate `"./index.html"` shell entry (`"./"` and `"./index.html"` are two Cache API keys holding identical 1.3 MB bodies — 2.6 MB stored, and the typical install re-downloads one of them (~428 KB gzip) redundantly), and bump `CACHE_NAME` whenever `SHELL_URLS` changes (the activate handler only deletes *other-named* caches, so removed URLs otherwise live forever).

**P12 — Warm the tile CDN connections.**
Only Google Fonts gets preconnects (`index.html:13-14`), but first map paint is gated on DNS+TLS to `{a-d}.basemaps.cartocdn.com` (tile layer created at 773, immediately at script run). Preconnect two tile shards + dns-prefetch the click-time API origins. Exact diff in §5 QW5.

**P13 — Trim two unused font weights.**
Line 15 requests 10 weights; the stylesheet uses 400/500/600/800/900 and there's no `<strong>`/`<b>`. Dropping Big Shoulders 700 and Inter 700 saves two font files and nothing else changes.

**Anti-finding, recorded so nobody "fixes" it:** `leaflet.js` at line 615 does **not** need `defer`. Lines 1–616 are only 19,297 bytes, so the preload scanner discovers it in the first ~19 KB and fetches it in parallel with the (long) HTML download; the inline classic-script IIFE at 617 depends on `L` synchronously, so adding `defer` would *break* boot, not speed it.

---

## 3. Refactoring & Code Quality

### 3.1 The generated-data pipeline (highest-risk area of the repo)

**R1 — Builders should emit data files, not rewrite a 1.3 MB HTML file** *(structural fix; unlocked by P0)*.
Today `build_il_roster.py`/`build_cpd_roster.py` locate JS object literals inside `index.html` with a lazy DOTALL regex (`replace_block`, `build_il_roster.py:99-103`) and splice replacements in. The review reproduced a plausible-anchor-drift scenario where that regex overmatches and **silently deletes 46,753 bytes of live modules** (a failure mode this repo has already experienced once — `docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md` records a module deleted by an earlier rewrite). Two builders also carry drifted copies of the same machinery: `build_cpd_roster.py`'s U+2028/U+2029 escaping is a **confirmed no-op** (it replaces the raw character with the same raw character — `cat -A` shows it; `build_il_roster.py:82` is correct). After P0, builders write `data/app/*.json` with `json.dump` and never touch HTML: the regex, the `</script`-escaping subtlety, and the drift risk all cease to exist. Until P0 lands: fix the U+2028 line (rewrite it fresh — the buggy line contains invisible characters, do not copy-paste), extract the shared `js_string`/`replace_block` into one imported module, and make `replace_block` fail on multiple matches.

**R2 — Make the geometry blobs regenerable.**
Verified: zero scripts reference the three embedded geometry variables; the school-board blob is canonically identical to its `data/` file (i.e., embedded-by-copy, never simplified), while the other two exist only as simplified snapshots of a mapshaper run nobody can repeat. Commit `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (or post-P0, `build_app_data.py`) that goes `data/*.geojson → simplify → round → data/app/*.json`, with the tolerance and validation protocol recorded in the script. The README's "Embedded boundary layers are topology-preserving simplifications" claim becomes true again (today it is false for school-board).

**R3 — Put validation between "bot rewrote the file" and "PR opened."**
Both workflows go straight from the rewrite to `gh pr create` with zero checks. Minimum bar, both < 1 s: `node --check` on the extracted inline script (44 ms measured — catches syntax death) + an output-side invariant check in the builders (count of `registerLayer(` blocks and dataset completeness after the rewrite, mirroring the input-side guards that already exist at `build_il_roster.py:119-126` and `build_cpd_roster.py:109-115`). Also extend the CPD guard to require a minimum count of non-null `commanderName`s — today a CPD site reword that nulls every commander sails through the district-count check. §5 QW3 has the exact workflow step.

**R4 — Commit the smoke test that the README already claims exists.**
`README.md:91-93` describes headless validation (node --check, parse5, Playwright boot + known-point district assertions) in the present tense; none of it is in the repo — it was built and run once during development, then not committed (`docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md` prose is the only trace). A ~40-line Playwright job on `pull_request` — boot, assert 18 layers registered via the already-exported `window.ChiExplorer`, click a known point, assert the three local layers' district answers — is the single highest-leverage DevEx investment here, and it makes R3's PRs trustworthy rather than merely syntax-valid. Until it exists, the README section should be reworded to past tense (doc/reality drift).

### 3.2 Failure honesty (the app's own rule 3)

**R5 — Overlay-load failure before a point is selected is completely silent on 15 of 18 layers.**
Verified repro: toggle a network layer on before tapping the map; if the boundary download fails, `onLayerToggled`'s catch (1423-1426) only `console.error`s and resets `rt.overlayLoaded` — no card state (cards aren't visible pre-point), no map-side signal, no auto-retry; the user just never sees boundaries and has no idea. Worst-case silent stall ≈ 28.5 s of nothing. Surface it: set a card-visible error state (the framework already has `setCardError` + Retry) and/or a small toast near the toggle: "Couldn't load [layer] boundaries — tap to retry." Related second-order gap: after a transient failure, nothing re-attempts the overlay except a manual re-toggle, even when a later `query()` for the same layer succeeds.

**R6 — Silent gray map when tiles fail.**
Zero `tileerror` handlers (grep-verified); offline users get a booted app (the SW shell works offline) over an empty gray map with no explanation. One `tileLayer.on("tileerror", …)` debounced into a dismissible banner ("Base map unavailable — selections still work") keeps the app honest in its most likely offline state.

### 3.3 Code consolidation

**R7 — Delete the duplicate cached-loader factory.** `makeCached` (2081-2089) is semantically identical to `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` (1581-1592) — 9 duplicated lines; 3 vs 10 call sites (verifier-corrected counts). Keep one, rename for clarity. §5 has the exact edit.

**R8 — Extract the Socrata route-walker.** `loadSocrataGeoJSON` (1560-1577) and `loadSocrataJSON` (2093-2110) are 18-line structural clones with the same single-catch-per-route subtlety (a past bug fix documented in one and inherited silently by the other). One `tryRoutes(urls, validate)` used by both. Verifier correction recorded: the four ArcGIS-style calls all use retries=2 — the genuine retry inconsistency is Socrata-primary 2 / fallback 1 / legislators 1 / POI 1, worth one comment line where they're set.

**R9 — One declarative polygon-layer factory.** The load → `findFeatureContaining` → `findPropCI` → `renderFieldList` pattern appears 12× (grep-verified call sites), 9 as standalone `registerLayer` blocks, ~250 near-duplicate lines. Three factories already exist (`registerSchoolZone`, `registerCpsNetwork`, `registerIlgaChamber`) proving the shape works; a generalized `registerPolygonLayer({loader, style, fields:[{label, props, optional}], enrich, pointOfInterest})` collapses most of the remaining nine. Do this *after* the quick wins land — it touches every module and deserves the R4 smoke test as a net.

**R10 — Repo/deploy hygiene.**
- Pages deploys the whole branch (classic CNAME-file deploy, no `.nojekyll`, no Pages workflow): scrapers, docs, and 4.6 MB of `data/` ship to the CDN. After P0, `data/app/` *must* deploy — but `data/source/raw/` (2.1 MB of zips/xlsx) still needn't. An actions-based Pages deploy that uploads only the app files (+ `.nojekyll` to skip the Jekyll pass) is ~20 lines.
- Bot branches are unique per run (`bot/ilga-roster-update-${run_id}`): an unmerged roster PR spawns a duplicate every week. Fixed branch name + force-push + `gh pr list` guard.
- Scraper deps float (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4`, `python-version: "3.x"`): heuristic HTML parsers are exactly the code that breaks on silent dependency drift. Pin via `scripts/requirements.txt` + `cache: pip`.
- `CPD_DISTRICT_INFO` is still the 32-byte placeholder — the CPD rewrite path has never run against real data in production; treat its first live PR with extra care (or land R3 first). **Root cause now identified — see R11.**

**R11 — The CPD scraper is blocked by Cloudflare's bot challenge; that is *why* the roster has never populated.**
Running `cpd_district_scraper.py` returns **HTTP 403 with `cf-mitigated: challenge`** on the district-finder page (`server: cloudflare`, `cf-ray` present) — a JavaScript/managed challenge, confirmed unchanged against a full real-browser header set (UA + `sec-ch-ua*` + `Sec-Fetch-*` + `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`). The `requests`-based fetcher can't execute the challenge's JS, so `get_district_pages` raises and the whole run exits non-zero at step 1. This is the mechanism behind R10's last bullet: the weekly `update-cpd-roster` job fails at the scrape every time, so `data/app/cpd-district-info.json` stays the `{}` placeholder. The other two scrapers (ilga.gov, congress-legislators — plain HTML / static JSON, no Cloudflare) are unaffected and were validated green (see the 2026-07-09 run above).
- *Safety net already holds — this is a completeness gap, not a correctness risk.* `build_cpd_roster.py`'s `MIN_DISTRICTS=20` input guard plus `validate_index.py`'s `cpd-district-info.json: 0` floor mean a blocked or partial scrape can never overwrite good data with holes; with the file empty, the Police District card degrades to "district number + official link," which is the project's intended honest failure.
- *Partial recovery SHIPPED — station address + phone no longer depend on the scrape.* A review of CPD's ArcGIS org (`services2.arcgis.com/t3tlzCPfmaQzSWAk`) found two CORS-enabled (`access-control-allow-origin: *`) FeatureServers covering part of the roster: `Police_District_Stations_View` (all 22 districts: `DISTRICT`/`NAME`/`ADDRESS`/`PHONE`) and `Police_District_Boundary_View` (the geometry the app already draws). A full sweep of the org's ~55 services confirmed **commander name/status/bio and CAPS phone/email exist nowhere** in it — those remain scrape-only. The Police District card now joins the already-loaded `Police_District_Stations_View` by district number and falls back to its `ADDRESS`/`PHONE` when the roster lacks them, so a click on any district shows real station address + main phone **even while the commander scrape is blocked**. The scraped roster still wins when present. This also fixed a latent join bug: the query keyed the roster on the raw zero-padded `DISTRICT` (`"008"`) instead of the bare integer (`"8"`) the roster uses — now routed through `extractDistrictNumber`. Verified against live ArcGIS data for three known points (Loop→D1, Wrigleyville→D19, Hyde Park→D2) with an empty roster, plus roster-precedence; `validate_index.py` green. The `districtMapUrl` field is effectively superseded by the boundary geometry the app renders; only commander + CAPS contact still need the scrape.
- *Commander/CAPS scrape fix SHIPPED — `cpd_district_scraper.py` now fetches through a real browser.* Added an `--engine {auto,requests,playwright}` switch: `playwright` drives a headless Chromium that executes Cloudflare's managed-challenge JS and reads the resulting rendered HTML (no evasion — a genuine browser), handing identical markup to the unchanged `parse_district_page`; `requests` is the fast browserless path; `auto` (default) tries `requests` and transparently falls back to `playwright` the instant the finder page is blocked (403 / challenge interstitial), so the weekly job works whether or not the runner's IP is challenged. Both engines share a `_looks_like_challenge` detector. The `update-cpd-roster` workflow now installs Chromium (`python3 -m playwright install --with-deps chromium`). Also landed alongside: R3's output guard (`build_cpd_roster.py` refuses a roster with `< MIN_COMMANDERS = 15` non-null commander names — a page reword that nulls the headline field can't silently ship) and R10's dep pinning (`scripts/requirements.txt`, `requests==2.33.1`/`beautifulsoup4==4.15.0`/`playwright==1.61.0`; the ILGA job pins via `pip -c` constraints without pulling Playwright).
  - *Verification:* the real Cloudflare site can't be reached from this sandbox (browser egress is proxy-blocked, same limitation noted throughout), so the challenge-clearing itself is validated against a **faithful local simulation** — a finder page that is a challenge interstitial to a non-JS client but whose JS rewrites the DOM to the real district links once executed (what a managed challenge does after it clears). Results: `requests`/`playwright`/`auto` produce **byte-identical records** on normal fixtures (engine parity); `requests`-only is correctly blocked by the JS-challenge finder while `auto` falls back to Playwright, clears it, and scrapes both districts; `build_cpd_roster.py` passes 22 commanders and refuses 10; the populated roster (bare-integer keys, matching the app's join) flows through `validate_index.py` green. What remains unproven is only whether CPD's *specific* Turnstile config auto-clears for a headless browser on a CI IP — if it turns out to need interactive mode, the honest fallback is to surface the weekly job as a **tracked failure/alert** rather than a silent red run, with the app's station-view address/phone fallback + graceful-degradation card already covering the gap.
  - *Live CI run (`update-cpd-roster`, workflow_dispatch, 2026-07-09):* answered the open question — **Turnstile auto-cleared for headless Chromium on GitHub's IP.** `requests` was 403'd on the finder (the runner IP *is* challenged), `auto` fell back to Playwright, and the browser fetched the finder page **and** a real district page. The guard then correctly refused the result — because the rendered finder yielded only **1** district link (district 11), not 22: the full list is lazy-loaded / behind a JS map widget, something only the live site reveals. Second CI run localized the real obstacle: the finder is an **address-search widget** that renders only one example link (district 11), and per-district pages carry **no** all-districts nav — so link-following discovery tops out at 1. Fix (shipped): discovery now uses CPD's **WordPress sitemap** as the district directory. `robots.txt` (served without a challenge) points at `/wp-sitemap.xml`; `get_district_pages` fetches the sitemap index, walks its child sitemaps, and harvests every `/Nth-district-slug/` `<loc>` — the canonical list of all 22 pages. The finder is still fetched first (cheap, and its Playwright navigation warms the `cf_clearance` cookie), but the sitemap is the source of truth. The `auto`-fallback decision was moved to a dedicated one-shot `requests` probe of the finder (discovery now swallows a blocked finder and leans on the sitemap, so it can no longer double as the block signal). Verified locally against sitemap fixtures: **both engines discover 22/22**, and the district URLs survive Chromium's XML-viewer rendering of the fetched sitemap. Third CI run confirmed the sitemap path finds all 22 live districts and fetches them — but surfaced a last parser gap: the live pages carry the commander name **inline** in the heading (`Meet your commander – Sheamus Mannion`, en-dash separated), whereas `parse_commander` expected the name in a *following* block, so it matched 1/22. Fixed: `parse_commander` now extracts the name after the dash in the heading (en/em-dash or hyphen), keeping the old trailing-block form as a fallback; guarded against prose-after-dash. Added a per-field coverage summary to the scrape (makes future parser drift obvious in one log line) and a `parse_commander` regression test covering both layouts + suffixes/initials/acting.
  - **RESOLVED — the pipeline works end-to-end against the live site (CI, 2026-07-09).** The confirmation run scraped all 22 districts, `build_cpd_roster.py` passed the guards, and `validate_index.py` passed with the populated roster — every district resolved a real commander (e.g. D1 Sheamus Mannion, D2 Herbert Williams III, D18 correctly flagged `acting_commander`), bio, station address, CAPS email, district-map URL, and source URL. `data/app/cpd-district-info.json` went from the 32-byte `{}` placeholder to a full 22-district roster. So: Turnstile clears headless on GitHub IPs, sitemap discovery finds all 22, and parsing works. Two residual notes, neither a blocker: (a) `mainPhone`/`capsPhone` come through null (the live pages no longer expose `tel:` links in the parsed block) — `mainPhone` is already covered by the app's ArcGIS station-view fallback; `capsPhone` is an honest null. (b) The workflow's final `gh pr create` step fails with *"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"* — a **repo setting**, not a code issue: enable Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" (this gates all three roster workflows). The bot branch is still pushed with the data, so a human can open the PR until the setting is flipped.

**Architecture verdict:** the layer-registry contract is right and survives all of the above unchanged. The single-page philosophy also survives — what changes is that *generated data* stops living inside hand-maintained source. Resist adding a build step or framework; after P0 the "build" is still just "run a Python script when data changes, commit the JSON."

## 5. Quick Wins (exact before/after)

### QW1 — Simplify the school-board blob: −892 KB raw, −316 KB gzipped, one regenerated line ✅ SHIPPED

*Shipped in this PR via `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (topology-aware mapshaper, not the per-ring approach sketched below — per-ring DP created a district overlap). Actual result: blob 975,796 → 83,470 B; `index.html` 1,301,984 → 409,712 B raw / 112,216 B gzip. The before/after shape is unchanged; only the numbers below are updated.*

`index.html:2553` today (975,796 bytes on one line; head shown):

```js
  var SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON = JSON.parse('{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":...   // 24,904 coord pairs, 14-15 decimals
```

After (83,470 bytes — same variable, schema, and district properties; geometry topology-simplified like its two sibling layers):

```js
  var SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON = JSON.parse('{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":...   // 3,525 coord pairs, 6 decimals
```

Measured: `index.html` 1,301,984 → 409,712 B (gzip 427,836 → 112,216). Validated with the app's own `pointInGeometry`/`findFeatureContaining`: 2000/2000 on the repo's protocol, 0 topology breaks, 0 internal wrong-district misses, 20/20 district interiors correct. Generated by the committed `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (which validates before it rewrites the line and refuses on failure), not by hand; provenance comment updated. This wins even if you do the externalization (P0) later — it's the same bytes, just in a fetched file.

### QW2 — sw.js: network-first shell (returning visitors currently always see last deploy's rosters)

`sw.js:52-61` before:

```js
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((cached) => {
      const network = fetch(event.request)
        .then((response) => {
          if (response.ok) {
            const clone = response.clone();
            caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.put(event.request, clone));
          }
          return response;
        })
        .catch(() => cached);
      return cached || network;
    })
  );
```

After (network-first with cache fallback — online visits are always current, offline still boots):

```js
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(event.request)
      .then((response) => {
        if (response.ok) {
          const clone = response.clone();
          caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.put(event.request, clone));
        }
        return response;
      })
      .catch(() => caches.match(event.request))
  );
```

The header comment's own rule ("staleness there is unacceptable") currently loses to `return cached || network` — the rosters live inside the cached shell. Online performance cost is one conditional request (GitHub Pages answers 304 + headers when unchanged).

### QW3 — 44 ms of `node --check` between "bot rewrote 1.3 MB of source" and "PR opened"

Both workflows, after the "Rebuild embedded roster" step and before "Check for changes" (`update-ilga-roster.yml:37` / `update-cpd-roster.yml:37`):

```yaml
      - name: Validate rewritten index.html still parses
        run: |
          python3 - <<'EOF'
          import re, subprocess, sys
          html = open("index.html").read()
          scripts = re.findall(r"<script>(.*?)</script>", html, re.DOTALL)
          assert scripts, "no inline scripts found"
          open("/tmp/inline.js", "w").write(max(scripts, key=len))
          subprocess.run(["node", "--check", "/tmp/inline.js"], check=True)
          assert html.count("registerLayer(") >= 15, "layer registrations went missing"
          EOF
```

This is the floor, not the ceiling (see matrix #5 for the real smoke test). Division of labor, verified empirically: `node --check` catches syntax death from a malformed splice but **not** the module-deletion overmatch — the over-matched output still parses — which is exactly what the `registerLayer(` count assertion (15 occurrences today: 1 definition + 11 direct calls + 3 factory bodies) is there to catch. Measured: 44 ms.

### QW4 — Ask TIGERweb for 11 cm coordinates instead of sub-nanometer ones

`index.html:2117-2118` before:

```js
    var url = "https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/Legislative/MapServer/" +
      layerIndex + "/query?where=" + where + "&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson";
```

After:

```js
    var url = "https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/Legislative/MapServer/" +
      layerIndex + "/query?where=" + where + "&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson&geometryPrecision=6";
```

~40% smaller payloads on the three heaviest network layers (coordinate digits beyond 6dp measure 41.5% of GeoJSON bytes); zero visual or classification difference at any zoom this map allows (maxZoom 18 ≈ 0.6 m/px). Apply the same parameter to `loadArcGISGeoJSON` (line 1607) and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2710-2711).

### QW5 — Warm the connections the first paint actually waits on

`index.html:13-14` before:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
```

After:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://b.basemaps.cartocdn.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org">
```

Tiles are requested the moment the inline script runs, from four sharded hosts that today get no warm-up (grep: fonts are the only resource hints in the file). Preconnecting two shards covers the initial viewport's parallelism; dns-prefetch on the click-time APIs is nearly free.

### Bonus one-liner — the geocoder's Enter-key double request

`index.html:1003-1005`: the submit handler never cancels the pending input-debounce timer, so pressing Enter within 550 ms of the last keystroke fires the search, then the debounce aborts it and re-issues an identical request (~550 ms + 1 RTT of added latency on the fast-typist path). Add `clearTimeout(debounceTimer);` as the first line of the submit handler — mirroring the guard the result-click handler already has at line 992.

## 6. Round 2 — the load-delivery campaign (2026-07-16)

*Source: `docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_2026-07.md`. Three lenses at 33 registered layers — a Chrome DevTools-Protocol harness (`scripts/perf_profile.mjs`), the **production PageSpeed Insights mobile** run (Lighthouse 13.4.0, Slow-4G, Moto G Power), and a **production Firefox Profiler capture** (real hardware, warm interaction). Every number below is measured; where a lens can't see something it's labelled.*

The 2026-07-09 campaign (§1–§5) did its job: it attacked **payload size** and **compute**, and production confirms both are solved — mobile posts **TBT 0 ms, CLS 0, Accessibility / Best-Practices / SEO all 100**, with 0 boot long tasks and ~32 ms of script eval. What that campaign could not see — it measured bytes, and ran sandboxed away from the real third parties — is **load *delivery***. Production mobile **Performance is 75**, and the whole 25-point gap is **FCP 3.3 s + LCP 5.0 s**: first paint waits ~2.1 s behind render-blocking third parties, and the LCP element is a CARTO basemap tile. The engine is done; the remaining wins are getting the page *painted* and getting live data *answered*.

**Why the numbers moved.** A first-pass in-sandbox Lighthouse proxy scored **96** because it stubbed Leaflet/fonts/tiles to boot offline — i.e. it deleted exactly the costs that dominate. The real run is **75**. Treat sandbox paint/network numbers as a *lower bound*; only production PSI (or a real-egress Lighthouse) scores the delivery path. (This is the same "environment-independent vs not" caveat the perf report leads with — it bit the score directly.)

### Round 2 matrix

| # | Task | Impact | Effort | Lens |
|---|------|--------|--------|------|
| R2-1 | ~~**Kill render-blocking (~2,110 ms):** fonts non-render-blocking (~780 ms) + inline `leaflet.css` (~750 ms) + defer `leaflet.js` (~1,340 ms)~~ ✅ **SHIPPED — all ~2,110 ms addressed** (boot now `DOMContentLoaded`-gated) | **High — every visit** | Low → Med | PSI |

| R2-3 | ~~Scope-mask: stop pulling the 83 KB school-board geometry at boot~~ ✅ **SHIPPED** — deferred to `requestIdleCallback` (fetch now starts after app-ready) | Medium | Low | PSI + sandbox |

| R2-6 | ~~**REOPEN P7(c)** — `pointInRing` **1.44 s** measured: bbox pre-reject in `findFeatureContaining`~~ ✅ **SHIPPED** (byte-identical to the NYC fork — parity 45/45). Canvas (P10) still reconsidered separately | Medium | Low → Med | Firefox |

**Execution log (2026-07-16, PR #113).** Shipped the unfenced, no-tradeoff wins in one pass — **R2-3, R2-4, R2-5, and the fonts half of R2-1** — none touching an ENGINE fence or GENERATED region. Fonts now load `media="print"`→`onload` non-render-blocking (`display=swap` already covered fallback text); the scope-mask wash and the water-taxi/county-seal preloads moved behind a shared `whenIdle()` (rIC + setTimeout fallback); the highlight drop-shadow pauses under a `.chi-panning` class on move/zoom. Verified: smoke test 15/15, a focused Playwright check (drop-shadow pauses on `movestart` / restores on `moveend`; scope-mask fetch starts after app-ready with the wash still rendering; selection marker intact), and the validate/parity/drift gates all green; boot metrics unchanged. **Then, owner-approved: `leaflet.css` inlined (~750 ms more).** The 14.8 KB Leaflet 1.9.4 CSS is now inlined at the top of the `<style>` block and its render-blocking cdnjs `<link>` removed; `metro-worksheet.json` dropped it from `shell_urls` and bumped the cache (`-v8 → -v9`), regenerated into `sw.js`. Safe because every app marker is an `L.divIcon`, so Leaflet CSS's image `url()`s (`marker-icon.png`, `layers.png`) are never matched — no missing assets. Tradeoff accepted: ~14.8 KB (~3.5 KB gzip) inlined into every response, and the inlined CSS is version-coupled to the CDN `leaflet.js` (a prominent comment marks the re-inline command; keep them in lockstep). Verified: `.leaflet-pane` computes `position:absolute` (inlined CSS applied), zero `leaflet.css` network requests, smoke 15/15, screenshot pixel-clean, all gates green. **So ~1,530 ms of the ~2,110 ms render-blocking is now gone.** **Then, `leaflet.js` deferred (~1,340 ms — R2-1 now complete).** The boot IIFE was converted to a named `initChiExplorer()` gated on `DOMContentLoaded`, and the Leaflet `<script>` given `defer`. This is precisely what the §2.4 anti-finding warned a *bare* `defer` would break — it's right that deferring Leaflet while the IIFE still ran at parse time would leave `L` undefined; the fix is to also defer the boot. Deferred scripts execute in order before `DOMContentLoaded`, so `L` is guaranteed defined when `initChiExplorer` runs. Leaflet now downloads in parallel with HTML parsing instead of blocking first paint. Verified in real Chromium: `leaflet.js` carries `defer`, `L` is defined + the map is ready at boot, **zero boot errors**, smoke 15/15, all R2 checks still green, boot metrics unchanged (the ~1,340 ms saving is a production render-blocking effect the sandbox can't show — it serves Leaflet locally/instantly — but the `defer` + parallel load is structurally confirmed). **All ~2,110 ms of PSI's render-blocking is now addressed** (fonts async + `leaflet.css` inline + `leaflet.js` defer). The §2.4 anti-finding is superseded and annotated in `index.html`. Re-run production PSI after deploy to confirm the FCP/LCP/score movement.

**Sequencing.** With R2-1 fully shipped, the render-blocking that held the mobile 75 is gone; **R2-2** (pre-build the decadal legislative geometry — a new builder + workflow, like P0/P2) is now the biggest remaining lever and targets *interaction* time-to-answer rather than load. R2-6's bbox reject is cheap but crosses the ENGINE fence, so it ships with the sibling-fork port. R2-7 is hygiene (the preconnect direction is ambiguous — PSI wants tile preconnects for the LCP tile *and* warns > 4, so it's cleanest after fonts self-hosting frees two slots). **Next PSI run should show the render-blocking opportunity near zero and FCP/LCP down from 3.3 s / 5.0 s.**

---

### R2-1 — Render-blocking third parties: ~2,110 ms of blocked first paint *(finding #1)*

PSI's top opportunity, and the reason mobile is 75. Three render-blocking resources in `<head>` (+ the pre-app `<script>`) gate first paint on a cold cache — which is exactly what Lighthouse measures:

| Resource | `index.html` | PSI block time |
|---|---|--:|
| `leaflet.js` (pre-app `<script>`) | `:1278` | 1,340 ms |
| `leaflet.css` (`<link rel=stylesheet>`) | `:104` | 750 ms |
| Google-Fonts CSS (`<link rel=stylesheet>`) | `:102` | 780 ms |

The fonts also pull **107 KiB of woff2** (four files, ~513 ms each) into the critical chain, and the **LCP element is a CARTO tile** that can't paint until Leaflet initializes — so cutting render-blocking moves *both* FCP (3.3 s) and LCP (5.0 s). Fixes, cheapest first:

- **Inline `leaflet.css`** into the existing `<style>` block (it's 3.8 KiB). Removes one render-blocking request outright; the SW precache entry for it can go too. Zero behavioral risk.
- **Self-host + subset the fonts.** Replace the `fonts.googleapis.com` `<link>` with a same-origin `@font-face` block (subset to the glyphs actually used) and commit the woff2. Removes the render-blocking third-party CSS *and* the four cross-origin font fetches; keeps `display=swap`. This is the bigger byte win and drops two of the five preconnects (feeds R2-7).
- **Async-load `leaflet.js`** — the stretch goal. ⚠️ The §2.4 **anti-finding still holds**: you can *not* just add `defer`, because the boot IIFE dereferences `L` synchronously. Async means restructuring boot to run on Leaflet's `load` event (or importing Leaflet as a module). Medium effort; do it last, after the two cheap wins above already reclaim ~1,530 ms.

*Nuance:* Leaflet + fonts are SW-precached, so **repeat** visits already skip the CDN. Render-blocking is a **first-visit** cost — but that's the visit that decides the PSI score and a new user's first impression, so it's worth fixing. *Fork note:* these are `<head>`/shell edits — confirm they're outside any `ENGINE:` fence before porting (the shell is fork-specific; the fonts/Leaflet URLs live in each fork's own head).

### R2-2 — Pre-build the decadal legislative geometry *(finding #2)*

The Firefox capture measured the real time-to-answer: **TIGERweb legislative query 5.69 s**, Nominatim 2.48 s, ArcGIS 0.90 s. Per-layer failure isolation means a slow source only stalls its own card, but 5.7 s *is* that card's answer time. The U.S. House + Illinois legislative district **geometry** still fetches live from TIGERweb (`loadTigerLayer`) even though those boundaries change **once a decade** (post-census redistricting) — the exact profile that P0 externalized for school-board / IL-Supreme-Court / Board-of-Review and P2 pre-built for the congress *roster*.

Extend that pattern to the geometry: a `build_legislative_boundaries.py` that fetches TIGERweb once, mapshaper-simplifies (the `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` protocol), and writes `data/app/*.json`; the layer loaders swap `loadTigerLayer` → `fetchJSONWithRetry` of the same-origin file (cache-first in the SW). A 5.7 s live query becomes a ~200 ms fetch. **Tradeoffs (name them):** it adds those datasets to the shipped payload *and* to the `validate_sources.py` freshness surface, and it ties into the decadal cadence in `docs/REDISTRICTING_RUNBOOK.md` (redistricting is exactly when these must be regenerated — the runbook already owns that trigger). Medium effort, highest interaction payoff.

**✅ SHIPPED (2026-07-16, PR #113).** New `scripts/build_legislative_boundaries.py` fetches Illinois features (`STATE='17'`) from TIGERweb Legislative layers 0/1/2, simplifies with mapshaper (Visvalingam keep-shapes, congress 12% / senate 10% / house 9%, 6-decimal precision), validates on the 2,000-point protocol, and writes `data/app/{congress,il-senate,il-house}-districts.json` — **all three built at 2000/2000 (100%) point-in-district agreement, 0 topology breaks**, at **130 / 151 / 185 KB gzip** (vs the ~982 KB / 1.35 MB / 1.8 MB live payloads — 7.6–9.7× smaller and now same-origin cache-first). Loader swaps: `congress` was a direct unfenced swap; `il-senate`/`il-house` needed a **backward-compatible `opts.loadDistricts` hook added to the `chamber-factory` ENGINE fence** (forks that don't pre-build still fall back to `loadTigerLayer(opts.layerIndex)` unchanged) — so that one-line engine change **ports to the sibling forks** per `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md`. `metro-worksheet.json` gained the three geometry files (feature counts 18/60/119, incl. a `ZZ` water pseudo-district each for byte-identical parity with the live query) and bumped the cache `-v9 → -v10`; `sw.js` regenerated (cache-first `GEOMETRY_URLS`); `validate_sources.py` moved TIGERweb-legislative from a live ENDPOINT to PROVENANCE (source reachable + built file present); `docs/REDISTRICTING_RUNBOOK.md` documents the now-mandatory rebuild on redistricting. **Verified** (the smoke test doesn't cover these layers): with TIGERweb *blocked*, congress/il-senate/il-house classify the Loop point to IL-7 / District 3 / District 5 (with roster joins — Davis / Hunter / Du Buclet), 0 TIGERweb requests, files fetched same-origin; smoke 15/15; validate/parity/drift gates green. These layers now also work in the sandbox (they couldn't before — the headless browser can't reach TIGERweb).

### R2-3 — The scope-mask pulls 83 KB of geometry at boot *(finding #3)*

**RESOLVED 2026-07-28 (the pre-dissolved-outline option, plus a coverage fix).** `drawOutOfScopeMask` now takes `loadMetroOutline` — `data/app/metro-outline.json`, one dissolved 7-county polygon of 62 vertices / 2.5 KB from `scripts/build_metro_outline.py` — so the 83 KB school-board fetch is off the boot path entirely and the runtime `coverageOutlineRings` dissolve has nothing left to cancel. It also corrected what the wash *means*: it had been drawing Chicago's city limits, greying out suburban Cook and all six collar counties, which resolve 17–25 of the 39 layers. Original finding below.

`drawOutOfScopeMask(loadSchoolBoardDistricts)` at `index.html:6508` (→ `:1884`) downloaded and `JSON.parse`d the **full 20-district school-board GeoJSON** at every boot to paint a *decorative* gray out-of-coverage wash. PSI confirms the cost independently: `school-board-districts.json` sits **in the initial-navigation critical chain at 669 ms**. This silently undoes P0's "a user who never toggles school-board never downloads a byte of it." Fixes: ship a small pre-dissolved `data/app/coverage-outline.json` (the `will-county-outline.json` pattern already exists — one MultiPolygon, a few KB, and it skips the runtime `coverageOutlineRings` dissolve), **or** defer the whole wash to `requestIdleCallback` so it never touches the boot path. Either is low-risk; the wash is explicitly best-effort (its own `catch` says "decorative — skip the wash").

### R2-4 — Marker icons warmed at boot for conditional markers *(finding #3, cont.)*

`water-taxi.png` (27 KB, `:1401`) and the county seals (`cook-county.png` 18 KB, `:1484`) are eagerly fetched at boot to make the first out-of-Chicago / on-water selection swap instantly — but they appear on a minority of sessions, and PSI flags them again under **cache lifetimes** (a 10-minute TTL, which is a GitHub-Pages platform default, not app-tunable without a CDN). So the lever isn't caching — it's **not fetching them until needed**: lazy-load on the first relevant selection (a single image decode, imperceptible), or at least move the warm into `requestIdleCallback`. ~46 KB off every cold visit.

### R2-5 — Drop-shadow pan tax, now measured *(finding #4; reopens item 25 / P9)*

The 2026-07-09 doc rejected this as "jank not observed." A controlled sandbox A/B now observes it: the two stacked `drop-shadow()`s on `.chi-region-highlight` (`:1010`) cost **3.7× pan-frame time** (61.6 ms vs 16.7 ms with the filter forced off), re-rasterizing a **2.3-Mpx** filter region every frame during pan/zoom (worst on low/mid mobile GPUs and with the huge IL-Supreme-Court "all of Cook County" highlight lit). Cheap, standard fix — the shadow is a static decoration that needn't re-raster mid-pan:

```js
// on map init:
map.on("movestart", function () { map.getContainer().classList.add("chi-panning"); });
map.on("moveend",   function () { map.getContainer().classList.remove("chi-panning"); });
```
```css
/* pause the filter only while the map is moving */
.chi-panning .chi-region-highlight { filter: none; }
```

Collapses pan cost to the filter-off baseline with **no change at rest**. (Alternative, permanent: swap the drop-shadow for a wider semi-transparent casing stroke — no raster-time filter at all.) *Fork note:* `.chi-region-highlight` styling is shared engine — port verbatim.

### R2-6 — Point-in-polygon has no bbox pre-reject *(finding #5; reopens P7(c) + item 24 / P10)*

The Firefox capture's hottest *app* function is **`pointInRing` at 1,437 ms** (`:1517`), called per feature by `findFeatureContaining` (`:3892`), which linearly ray-casts every polygon in a boundary set. P7 memoizes the scan per click, but P7(c) — a per-feature bounding-box reject — was measured-but-never-shipped. The capture makes it worth shipping. And the helpers **already exist in the file** (`featureBBox` / `bboxIntersect`, used by the hover-containment feature at `:1627`/`:1659`), just not on the click path:

```js
function findFeatureContaining(geojson, point) {
  // …existing memo-cache check…
  var features = geojson.features || [];
  var found = null;
  for (var i = 0; i < features.length; i++) {
    var f = features[i];
    var bb = f.__bbox || (f.__bbox = featureBBox(f));           // compute once, cache on the feature
    if (point.lng < bb[0] || point.lng > bb[2] ||               // cheap reject before the ray-cast
        point.lat < bb[1] || point.lat > bb[3]) continue;
    if (pointInGeometry(point, f.geometry)) { found = f; break; }
  }
  geojson.__pointQueryCache = { point: point, feature: found };
  return found;
}
```

**✅ SHIPPED (2026-07-16).** `findFeatureContaining` now calls `featureBBox(features[i])` (which already memoizes on `__hoverBBox`) and `continue`s past any feature whose bbox excludes the point before the ray-cast — answer-identical (a feature whose bbox excludes the point cannot contain it). Because it's an ENGINE-fence change, it shipped as the **actual git diff to both forks in lockstep**: the same edit landed in CHI *and* the NYC fork (`DistrictExplorer-NYC`), which was imported and edited byte-identically — `check_engine_parity.py --against --strict` confirms **45/45 identical, 0 drift**, and both forks' smoke tests pass (CHI classifies the Loop anchors, NYC classifies City Hall → Manhattan and correctly returns the empty state at a mid-river point — proving the reject introduces no false matches). The NYC commit also carried the **R2-2 `opts.loadDistricts` chamber-factory hook** that CHI had drifted, so the two forks are fully re-synced. The benefit scales with rendered feature count — biggest on the many-feature layers (community areas 77, wards 50, and the now-same-origin legislative layers: IL House 119 features).

⚠️ **`findFeatureContaining` and `pointInGeometry` are inside the `ENGINE:BEGIN` fences** — per `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md` this must ship as the *actual git diff* to every sibling fork, not re-described (done above). **Canvas renderer (item 24 / P10)** is the same story reconsidered: the capture measured Leaflet SVG reproject/repaint at **4.15 s / 70 % of page JS**, so the gain is no longer hypothetical — but canvas still breaks the `_path.classList` highlight, so it's viable only *after* R2-5 moves the drop-shadow off per-path classList during motion. Order: bbox reject now (cheap, big), canvas later (bigger, only if profiling still shows SVG restyle dominating after R2-5).

### R2-7 — Load hygiene *(finding #6)*

- **Trim preconnects to ≤ 4 — this partially reverses QW5 / item 14.** That quick win added `a.` + `b.basemaps.cartocdn.com` preconnects; the page now ships **5** (`:90–98`) and PSI warns *"More than 4 preconnect connections… use sparingly"* plus flags one **unused**. Self-hosting the fonts (R2-1) already removes two; otherwise drop a tile-shard preconnect. Honest note: a prior optimization slightly overshot — the fix is tuning, not reverting the idea.
- **Oversized `@2x` tiles (56 KB).** The tile template's `{r}` token (`:1750`) resolves to `@2x` on any high-DPR phone, serving 512×512 PNGs for a 448×448 box. Dropping `{r}` serves 256×256 tiles — ~56 KB lighter, slightly softer on retina. A visual-quality tradeoff to decide, not a clear win; CARTO's endpoint has no WebP swap.
- **Unused / unminifiable JS (60 KB / 41 KB).** Expected for a single-file app that registers all 33 layer modules up front, and it's a **deliberate no-build tradeoff** (gzip already recovers most of the minify delta on the wire). Not a defect to "fix" — but deferring per-layer module bodies until first toggle is the one structural option, and it cuts against the one-readable-file value, so it's an owner call, explicitly *not* recommended lightly.

**Coherent PR groupings (Round 2):** **PR-H** (R2-1 cheap half: inline `leaflet.css` + self-host fonts + R2-7 preconnect trim — one `<head>` pass, the biggest score move); **PR-I** (R2-3 + R2-4, boot-payload lazy-loading); **PR-J** (R2-5 + R2-6, the reopened render/PIP items — R2-6 carries the fork port); **PR-K** (R2-2, the legislative-geometry pre-build, standalone like P0/P2); **PR-L** (R2-1 stretch: async Leaflet boot restructure, only if PR-H's gain isn't enough). Land PR-H first — it's low-effort and it's what moves the mobile 75.

> **Round 2 status (2026-07-16): R2-1…R2-7 all shipped on both forks** (CHI + NYC), engines re-synced at parity 45/45. R2-7 shipped the preconnect trim first; then a production PSI run (see `docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_2026-07.md` "Production verification") showed R2-1 won big on FCP (3.3→1.2 s) / SI (3.4→1.6 s) but the score is now **LCP-bound** (a basemap tile) with a small font-swap CLS — which **justified self-hosting the fonts** (held earlier as marginal). Now **shipped**: same-origin `@font-face` (`scripts/build_fonts.py`) drops the two font preconnects and gives those slots to the LCP tile shards (a/b/c), and a metric-matched Inter fallback cuts the swap CLS — this also **reverses the R2-7 `b.` preconnect trim**, which the live data showed was the wrong direction for a tile LCP. Still held: dropping `{r}`/@2x tiles (retina/mobile sharpness regression) and deferring per-layer JS (violates the single-file no-build architecture); TBT is the owner's Google Tag Manager. The remaining lever is the render path itself — §7.
>
> **Banked at 78 (2026-07-16).** The post-self-host PSI confirmed the reallocation (LCP 6.4→5.9 s, SI 1.6→1.3 s, score 76→**78**). CLS stayed 0.052 — the `Inter Fallback`'s `local('Arial')` doesn't resolve on the Android test device, so it helps Win/Mac only; 0.052 is still "good". The app is at its **tradeoff frontier**: the map-tile LCP is near its Slow-4G floor, and every remaining PSI point costs real UX (blurry @2x tiles), brand (first-visit fallback fonts via `font-display: optional`), analytics (defer GTM), or the single-file design (minify). Full arc + the frontier table in `docs/PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_2026-07.md` "Production verification". Campaign rests here; §7 (canvas) remains the interaction — not load-score — lever.

## 7. Round 3 — the render path (canvas), scoped + measured (2026-07-16)

> Round 2 fixed load delivery (R2-1) and interaction *compute* (R2-5 pan
> drop-shadow, R2-6 point-in-polygon). What's left is the render path: Leaflet
> paints every district as an SVG `<path>` DOM node, and a production Firefox
> capture put Leaflet "reproject/repaint" at **4.15 s / 70 % of page JS** over
> an interaction session. The canonical fix is the canvas renderer. Phase 0
> below **re-measures** that cost against the current tree (the 4.15 s predates
> R2-5/R2-6) — and the number changes the recommendation.

### R3-1 — Canvas renderer for the many-polygon layers *(reopens P10 / item 24)*

**Why it's unusually low-risk *here*.** The generic objection — "canvas breaks
click/hover, there's no per-feature DOM to hit-test" — does **not** apply to
this app. Every hit-test is already done in JS against the cached geojson, not
via Leaflet SVG events: click-select is `map.on("click")` → `findFeatureContaining`
(point-in-polygon); the hover-explorer runs `findFeatureContaining` on
mousemove; the selection highlight *matches* via `findFeatureContaining` and
*styles* via `setStyle()` (renderer-agnostic). The **only** SVG-bound effect is
the drop-shadow filter applied through `subLayer._path.classList`, and that path
is already guarded (`if (subLayer._path)`), so under canvas it's a graceful
no-op, not a crash. Switching polygon layers to canvas therefore touches exactly
one thing: the drop-shadow "floating" look degrades to the darkened thick-stroke
highlight (`highlightStyleFor`, already applied) on canvas'd layers.

**Phase 0 re-measurement — DONE (`perf_profile.mjs` phase 5).** Loaded the 6
same-origin polygon layers (3 anchors + the 3 pre-built legislative layers =
**230 paths**) and CPU-profiled a pan and a zoom, vs the 3 anchors alone
(**33 paths**). Headless software-GL, so absolute ms are inflated — but the CPU
top-fn *shape* and the many-vs-few *ratio* are environment-independent:

- **Zoom CPU is projection-dominated.** The top three frames are all
  projection: `latLngToPoint` **101 ms**, `_projectLatlngs` 37 ms,
  `latLngToLayerPoint` 16 ms (≈ 150 ms of ~263 ms). Projecting lat/lng → pixels
  happens under **any** renderer — **canvas removes none of it.**
- **Pan is SVG-shaped and cheap in JS.** `setAttribute` + `_clipPoints` lead;
  pan frame-time scales ~2× for 7× the paths (44 → 89 ms median, ~224 µs/path
  marginal) — the per-path DOM-write + SVG-paint cost canvas *does* remove.

**Refined verdict: canvas is a real but *bounded* win, and the sandbox can't
size it.** What canvas removes is the DOM-write (`setAttribute`/`pointsToPath`)
and the browser's 230-node SVG *paint* (collapsed to one canvas). What it can't
remove is projection (~150 ms of the zoom CPU here). Two consequences:

1. The canvas-favourable half is the **browser SVG paint**, which a software-GL
   headless run inflates but can't cleanly quantify — so the **go/no-go needs a
   real-hardware (GPU/phone) paint profile**, not this sandbox. The sandbox's
   job was to reveal the projection floor, and it did.
2. **Pair canvas with vertex reduction.** The projection cost canvas can't touch
   is linear in vertex count. The pre-built layers were simplified for *payload*
   (R2-2); a tighter simplify (or the app's own display tolerance) cuts
   projection directly — the complement to canvas, cheap to try.

### Implementation plan (Phase 1), if the GPU profile confirms paint-bound

All touch-points sit inside ENGINE fences, so the change lands in CHI and ports
**byte-identically** to every sibling (`docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md`); the *per-layer
opt-in* is metro config, so no city value enters a fence.

1. **`buildOverlayLayer` (`overlay-cards` fence).** Add `renderer:
   mod.overlay.renderer` to the `L.geoJSON` options; create one shared engine
   `var overlayCanvas = L.canvas({ padding: … })`.
2. **Per-fork opt-in (metro config).** Each fork sets `overlay.renderer =
   overlayCanvas` on its high-path layers (CHI: the 3 school-zone + 2
   CPS-network ≈ 500 paths; candidates wards / community-areas / il-house).
   Low-count layers stay SVG and keep their drop-shadow.
3. **Highlight (`layer-registry` fence).** No code change — the `if
   (subLayer._path)` guard already degrades gracefully; add a comment that
   canvas layers use the setStyle-only highlight.
4. **(Optional) Phase 2 — preserve the drop-shadow** on canvas'd layers via a
   dedicated SVG overlay pane that redraws only the single matched feature.
   Only if the setStyle-only highlight reads as a downgrade.

**Untouched:** `relationship-pinning` outlines (few, capped — stay SVG),
`scope-mask` (own pane), every point-marker layer (police/fire/school-site).

### Verification
Re-run `perf_profile.mjs` phase 5 before/after (the paint-half delta is the
number that justifies it) · smoke on both forks (classification is JS-side, so
untouched) · screenshots of the highlight (the one visual tradeoff) ·
`check_engine_parity.py --strict` 45/45 · manual pan/zoom with all layers on, on
real hardware.

### Effort
Phase 0 **done**. Phase 1 ≈ 1 day (small fenced change + per-fork flags + port +
verify). Vertex-reduction complement ≈ ½ day (re-run `build_*_boundaries.py` at a
tighter tolerance, re-clear the 2,000-point gate). Phase 2 (SVG highlight pane)
≈ 1–2 days, only if the highlight downgrade matters.

**Gate before Phase 1:** a real-hardware capture that shows SVG *paint* (not
projection) as the felt bottleneck. If projection dominates on GPU too, do the
vertex-reduction pass first — it's the cheaper lever for a projection-bound cost.

## 8. Scripts audit — 2026-08-24

The whole of `scripts/` was re-run through the §"Redundant/orphaned-script
review" question, thirteen months of county expansion later. The 2026-07-09
answer above was measured against **eight** scripts; this one was measured
against **257** files (73k lines), and both its halves came out differently.

**The fleet was healthier than its size suggests.** 176 scripts are run by a
workflow; ~21 more are import-reachable shared libraries
(`build_metro_outline.py` alone has 33 importers — it is the de facto
constants module for `METRO_COUNTY_FIPS`/`DISPATCH_COUNTY_FIPS`); every
one-shot geometry builder's output still ships in `data/app/` (18/18
spot-checked), and 24 of the 33 not-in-a-workflow builders carry a `--check`
that doubles as the county's re-precincting drift gate. **Exactly one file was
genuinely dead**: `build_rock_island_tax_districts.py`, deleted by its own
supersession commit (`9753cb8`, 2026-08-16 — the successor's docstring records
"Supersedes …", which is this repo's script-retirement convention) and then
silently resurrected by a merge (`f19790e`, 2026-08-21). Deleted again. The
zombie mechanism is worth a sentence: a branch cut before a deletion and
merged after it restores the file with no conflict and no reviewer surface.

**One script was unreferenced rather than dead**: `indexnow_submit.py`, whose
ownership key file deploys with every release while nothing ever submitted.
Wired into `deploy-pages.yml` as a best-effort post-deploy job. Four builders
advertised a `--check` no workflow invoked (`backfill_board_seats`,
`build_jefferson_board_districts`, `build_menard_commissioner_districts`,
`build_montgomery_boundaries`) — three behind workflow header comments
claiming the check ran "on every pull request". All four are now wired
(smoke-test for the stdlib one; the county's own weekly workflow for the
three offline geometry re-checks, the mcdonough/stark pattern).

**The duplication measurements, and what was done with each:**

| Measurement | Disposition |
|---|---|
| 93 byte-identical `fail()` templates (of 101 `def fail`; 8 deliberate variants) | `scraper_common.make_fail(label)`, output byte-identical |
| 8 multi-file User-Agent strings (Chrome/126 alone in 42 definitions; 96 dict-form definitions total) + 10 single-file | The 8 became `scraper_common.UA_*` constants — **the definition is consolidated, never the value** (a changed UA can change how a county site treats a client); the 10 single-file strings stay local |
| 4 hand-rolled retry shapes across ~20 fetch loops; only `henry_county_board_scraper.py`'s honours Retry-After and refuses to retry 404 | `scraper_common.fetch()` encodes the henry semantics, proven by a committed localhost selftest (`selftest_scraper_common.py`); 13 fetches migrated, 5 vetted and left bespoke for named reasons (hancock/lasalle/kane/lake/isbe), Playwright/archive/TLS ladders untouched |
| TLS-pin machinery ×4 across 3 CAs, though `aia_bundle.py:19` said "this is the one copy" | Folded into a keyed `aia_bundle.INTERMEDIATES` table; pins moved byte-for-byte and re-verified live |
| ~1,850 lines of pre-module VTD machinery in the clark/white/shelby builders (the migration `vtd_board_districts.py`'s own preamble pre-authorized) | All three migrated, each proven by its `--check` byte-compare against the shipped files. The audit's earlier "~2,280 lines" figure had wrongly counted `build_montgomery_boundaries.py` — a pyogrio/.gdb builder with no VTD machinery at all; only its `--check` wiring was in scope |
| `perf_profile.mjs` hand-mirroring smoke-config ("kept in sync by hand", its own header) | Now a worksheet-keyed `generate_metro_files.py` opt-in target (`perf_profile` key, the `verified_date` pattern) |

**The 2026-07-09 ruling is superseded — by half.** "Keep scrapers standalone"
was right about the heuristic half and still is: parsers, selectors, zero-row
guards and per-county quirks stay in the county's own file, where a reader
looks for them. It is superseded for the machinery half, and had already been
superseded in practice by `vtd_board_districts.py`, `platinum_canvass.py` and
`aia_bundle.py`: **genuinely-identical machinery — fail voices, UA
definitions, retry plumbing, TLS pins, VTD dissolve mechanics — lives in a
shared module with a "why this is shared" docstring.** The test between the
halves: if two copies could drift and a reader would want them to stay
identical, it is machinery; if a copy encodes something one county does, it is
heuristic.

**Explicit KEEP decisions, so the next audit reads the count instead of
repeating the work:** the ISBE pair (`isbe_county_officers_scraper.py` +
`build_county_board_chairs.py`) is a reproducible negative measurement — its
output is proof ISBE's chair data is substantially wrong (16 of 56 comparable,
29%, on 2026-08-20; 23 of 75, 30.7%, on a fresh 2026-09-06 rebuild — the
denominator grows as counties ship rosters, so the figure is quoted with its
date), "kept reproducible so the
claim can be re-tested rather than re-argued" — and is not dead code;
`build_og_image.mjs` belongs to the districtry
product track and is allowed-stale by its own design (`build_districtry_preview.py`
sat beside it until R4.2 ADOPTED the skin it previewed, at which point a
2,440-line builder and its 27,331-line output were deleted — a preview earns its
keep until the thing it previews exists); the seal and font
asset generators (`render_seal_svg.mjs`, `convert_raster_seal.py`,
`build_fonts.py`) are the reproducibility recipes for committed binary
assets; and `validate_workflow_deps.py` vs `check_roster_workflow_health.py`
are complementary (static pre-merge import gate vs post-hoc run watchdog),
not overlapping.
